How does this funny word also act as an insult &#8230; particularly to women?</p>\n<p>The origins of\u00a0<em>hysterical</em>\u00a0have something to do with it. <em>Hysterical\u00a0</em>comes from the word\u00a0<em>hysteria\u00a0</em>which\u00a0comes from the Greek\u00a0<em>hysterik\u00f3s</em>, meaning \u201csuffering in the womb.\u201d</p>\n<p>So, yeah, the ancient Greeks believed that when a woman was being &#8220;irrational&#8221; it was because her uterus was literally wandering around her body causing trouble. That&#8217;s not hilarious.</p>\n<p>A number of ailments and attitudes were blamed on hysteria, including anxiety, boldness or outspokenness, sexual desire, and\u2014no joke\u2014the suffragist movement.</p>\n<p>And this should, perhaps, give us some pause before we call someone \u201chysterical.\u201d The word\u2019s origin ties it to the idea that any show of emotion or force from a woman is evidence of her fragility and instability &#8230; and women are anything but.</p>\n<p>Not to mention there are better options:\u00a0<em>hilarious </em>options\u00a0to be exact &#8230; and <em>hilarious</em>&#8216;s origins are full of &#8220;cheerfulness, gaiety, and merriment.&#8221; No gendered insults hiding there! In fact, in ancient Rome\u00a0<span class=\"foreign notranslate\">Hilaria</span>\u00a0were a class of holidays, times of pomp and rejoicing.</p>\n<p>So, funny people rejoice: we now have a clear descriptor &#8230; we&#8217;re f&#8217;ing hilarious.</p>\n",

It doesn\u2019t make a difference either way, because dreaming is uplifting and if we keep the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Dream</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as alive as it was in the darkest of times in 1931 \u2026 maybe it\u2019ll help those in the future sleep better.</span></p>\n",

                    "transcript": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The word <i>mad </i>really drives me \u2026 <i>mad</i>. I mean, just think about it. <i>I\u2019m so mad at you</i>, I could say. That means \u201cI\u2019m so angry at you.\u201d But what if I said <i>I\u2019m so mad about you</i>. That means \u201cI\u2019m crazy about you.\u201d Those are like two opposite things, infuriation and infatuation. How can this one word, <i>mad</i>, be both?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So, <i>mad </i>originally meant \u201cdemented, crazy, or out of one\u2019s mind.\u201d We can find this sense recorded by the 1300s\u2014and it\u2019s still around today. <i>Stark, raving mad</i> or <i>mad scientist</i>, for instance, are about some seriously loose screws. Or, <i>mad dog</i>. The very earliest evidence for <i>mad</i>, in fact, describes a dog as having rabies. Now, <i>mad dog </i>is something of nickname for a manly man who goes all out\u2014he might even give a <i>mad dog stare</i>, or a threatening, crazed look. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You\u2019ll especially encounter <i>mad </i>as \u201cinsane\u201d in British English, whereas <i>mad </i>for \u201cangry\u201d appears more common in American English. But, \u201cangry\u201d <i>mad</i> was around long before the United States. It\u2019s found by the 1400s.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Both are states of extreme agitation. When you\u2019re <i>mad as hell</i> or <i>mad as a hornet</i>, you\u2019ve really gotten carried away.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And, when something really gets carried away, say, like a sax player ripping a solo, it\u2019s really intense. It\u2019s really exciting. It\u2019s really good. That\u2019s how <i>mad </i>becomes slang for \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201ccool\u201d in jazz slang by the 1940s. This <i>mad </i>later, by the 1990s, shifted to a sense of \u201cabundant\u201d or \u201cgreat in amount,\u201d like a rapper who has <i>mad skills</i> or gets <i>mad respect</i>. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The next time someone tries to push your buttons by saying <i>You mad, bro?</i>, ask them some follow-up questions. <i>Do you mean I\u2019m \u201ccrazy\u201d?</i> <i>Or I\u2019m \u201cangry\u201d?</i> <i>I\u2019m \u201cextra\u201d?</i> <i>Or I\u2019m \u201creally awesome\u201d? </i>That\u2019ll drive \u2018em <i>mad</i>.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

I eat fish. And don\u2019t get me wrong: I love a good bacon cheeseburger. That\u2019s the whole idea of <i>abstinence</i>, though: I\u2019m voluntarily restraining myself from something I enjoy but know is harmful for me.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">See, I\u2019m concerned about how much raising cattle contributes to climate change.

And then, there&#8217;s Hawkeye.</p>\n<p>He and Klinger were out there organizing the wounded by the severity of their wounds, and prioritizing who would get surgery first, and in some cases, who was too far gone for surgery. Life and death decisions. This was the definition of\u00a0<em>triage</em>.</p>\n<p>But, today, the word has become watered down. People use it in all sorts of situations when they&#8217;re talking about scheduling items or prioritizing events. I was in a big box store the other day, and a manger walked up to one of his co-workers, and he says, &#8220;Hey&#8230; there&#8217;s a new truck out on the loading dock, can you meet Frank and help him\u00a0<em>triage</em> it?&#8221;</p>\n<p>different way. It\u2019s become watered down to mean ANY situation where people need to prioritize a schedule or organize items. The other day I was in one of the Big Box home improvement stores.

I want you and Frank to run triage on it.\u201d</p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t say anything, but the thought-bubble above my head:<br />\n\u201cYou keep using that word.

A <i>stack</i>? <i>Pile</i>? <i>Trash</i>? All that work you\u2019ve been putting off? </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What about <i>dossier</i>?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When you read the word <i>dossier</i>, it looks like [<b><i>doss</i></b><i>-ee-ur</i>]\u2014like it means <i>more</i> <i>dossy</i>, whatever that is. But, when you hear the word <i>dossier</i>, it sounds like some fancy, French perfume. [<b><i>Doss</i></b>&#8211;<i>ee</i>&#8211;<i>ey</i>.]</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Well, <i>dossier</i> is French, but ain\u2019t perfume\u2014and it ain\u2019t all that fancy once you get to know it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Borrowed into English by the late 1800s, a <i>dossier</i> is \u201ca collection or file of documents on the same subject, especially a complete file containing information about a person or topic.\u201d That is, \u201ca bundle of related papers.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Today, we often see <i>dossier</i> in criminal contexts. For instance, the FBI has kept <i>dossiers</i> on everyone from Frank Sinatra of the Rat Pack to Ol\u2019 Dirty Bastard of the Wu-Tang Clan. These were files tracking, among other things, their possible criminal gang activity\u2014in Sinatra\u2019s case, the Mafia; in O.D.B.\u2019s, the Bloods. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And, in recent years, you may have heard about the <i>Steele Dossier</i>. These are memos kept by a former British secret agent containing allegations of collusion between Russia and Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign to help him win the election.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Note that <i>dossiers</i> don\u2019t necessary mean crimes have been committed or that a person has been convicted. The FBI never charged Ol\u2019 Dirty Bastard or Ol\u2019 Blues Eyes. As for Trump?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Let\u2019s just that when the intelligence community has a <i>dossier</i> on you, you might really feel like you\u2019re back is to the wall. Literally, in the case of <i>dossier</i>. The root of <i>dossier</i> in French is <i>dos</i>, [doh] meaning \u201cback,\u201d from the Latin <i>dorsum</i>, like a <i>dorsal</i> fin on the back of dolphin. Apparently, <i>dossiers</i> were likened to the way big bundles of paper bulge like curve of the back. Or, it could just be they had a label on their backs for what they were about. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">[ADDITIONAL CONTENT IF DESIRED &gt; Fun fact: Square dancing seems a long way from France and its tricky words like <i>dossier</i>, but if you\u2019ve ever danced the <i>do-si-do</i>, you\u2019re doing a move where you pass your partner around the back. It comes from the French <i>dos-\u00e0-dos</i>, literally \u201cback to back.\u201d]</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Don\u2019t let a word like dossier be any skin off your back. Sometimes there&#8217;s the perfect word to describe something\u2014like <i>dossier</i>\u2014but we aren&#8217;t confident enough to use it because its pronunciation is hard because its origins are French or because it&#8217;s too hard to spell because its origins are French! We&#8217;re all insecure about words. There&#8217;s no need to &#8230; &#8220;back&#8221; off from them.</span></p>\n</div>\n</section>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

It\u2019s funny it had so much of an effect coming from such a tiny old lady sitting on a park bench. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, when I started to think more about it for a second, I wondered if it had to do with where the word got its start. Since way back, it\u2019s always meant the possessive \u201cmy\u201d or \u201cmine,\u201d whether it\u2019s the Old English </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">m\u012bn</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or the Middle English </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mi</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weirdly enough, people would use </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">my</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in front of words starting with vowels and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mine</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with consonants, a fact my grandma would\u2019ve been equally impressed with, but I digress. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of times, people would use the word </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">my</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in tandem with the word </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">God</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as in \u201cmy God!\u201d Over time (around 1825, to be exact), it looks like the \u201cGod\u201d was occasionally dropped from the sentence and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">my</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> stood all by its lonesome \u2026 yet it still held the power of the original interjection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, one tiny word, two letters, yet it has a long history and a powerful punch. Kind of like my Grandma to think of it \u2026 she may look tiny, but I wouldn\u2019t want to be on her bad side. I\u2019ve seen how she talks to the butcher when he gives her a bad cut of meat. My, my, my, Grandma.</span></p>\n</div>\n",

This is \u201cfavoritism shown on the basis of family relationship,\u201d such as giving an important job to a son or daughter, say, over a more qualified candidate.\u00a0</span>But you might be less familiar with where this word comes from.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The word <i>nepotism</i> came into English in the 17th century based on the Italian <i>nepotismo </i>[ney-poh-<b>teez</b>-moh]. This referred to a historic practice in the Catholic Church where popes and bishops put relatives, including nephews, into positions of privilege.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Nephew</i> is the key word here, as the origin of <i>nepotismo</i> is the Latin <i>nepos </i>[<b>ney</b>-pohs], meaning \u201cnephew.\u201d Our own word\u00a0<i>nephew</i> comes from this same root. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Nephew</i> is also the key word because, in the Middle Ages, popes commonly made cardinals out of the nephews of existing cardinals. They were known, appropriately enough, as <i>Cardinal Nephews</i>. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Other popes, however, appointed or bestowed church land and money on secret lovers and illegitimate sons, who were conveniently called \u201cnephews.\u201d Clever euphemism, Il Papa.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Nepotism</i>, as you can imagine, became a big problem for the Catholic Church, as favoring family corruptly consolidates wealth and power. In fact, it\u2019s said to have contributed to the policy of celibacy in the Church and to the Protestant Reformation.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One of the most notorious <em>nepotists</em> in the Catholic Church was Pope Sixtus IV [say \u201cthe fourth\u201d for IV], whose other claim to fame was restoring, oh, only a little something called the Sistine Chapel. The more aptly named Innocent XII [say \u201cthe twelfth\u201d for XII] officially banned nepotism in the church.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Not that that stopped <em>nepotism</em> elsewhere. You know that new intern in the graphic design department? Only the daughter of an HR manager. Or that Senior Adviser to the president supposedly negotiating peace in the Middle East? Just his son-in-law. Sheesh.\u00a0</span></p>\n",

And, then stick a Sennheiser 416 on that mic stand.</p>\n<p>Every industry has its own jargon, but it was a little overwhelming for me at 21 years old, when I got hired as an assistant audio engineer at a recording studio. Most of our clients were advertising agencies doing radio and TV commercials. So, our jargon involved words like ISCI codes and ISDN hook-ups and LKFS measurements.</p>\n<p>So while it\u2019s really not surprising that one definition of <em>jargon</em> is, &#8220;language specific to a profession.\u201d But another definition is, &#8220;unintelligible or meaningless talk or writing, gibberish.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It sure seemed like gibberish to me when I was first starting out. One day I showed up at work and I asked my boss what we were doing that day, and he said once the clients show up we\u2019re gonna be recording a bunch of donuts for a bunch of radio commercials.</p>\n<p>I had no idea what he was talking about. But, if clients were coming over with donuts we were gonna need a lot more coffee. So I went into the lounge to start a few more pots.</p>\n<p>After a while, my boss wanders over and he goes, \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d And I said, well if people are coming over with donuts, I\u2019m gonna need more coffee. He goes, \u201cMichael, you know how there are singers at the beginning of a commercial and there are singers at the end of a commercial? We\u2019re recording the voice over that goes in the hole in the middle. The donut!\u201d</p>\n<p>You know, I can laugh about it now. But, I swear I thought the next two words out of his mouth were gonna be, you\u2019re fired.</p>\n",

Jessica is so\u00a0<em>canceled</em> after the awful things she said about you on Twitter. Oh, hold on&#8230; I have a customer.</p>\n[<em>Puts phone down looks to camera</em>] Oh, hi! Seems like you might be looking up the word\u00a0<em>cancel</em> on the dictionary! I can totally give you the scoop.</p>\n<p><em>Canceling</em>\u00a0is something we&#8217;ve all done. You <em>cancel</em> your plans, you <em>cancel</em> your subscriptions, or, if you have my luck, your credit cards and favorite TV shows are always getting\u00a0<em>canceled</em>. [<em>ugh, eye-roll</em>]\n<p>Something you might not know about the verb\u00a0<em>cancel\u00a0</em>is that, back in the 1400s, it meant &#8220;to cross or strike out&#8221; a piece of writing. Like, literally drawing an X through it. The word&#8217;s Latin root literally refers to &#8220;cross-bars&#8221; or &#8220;lattice,&#8221; like on a fence.</p>\n<p>So, if you &#8220;cross&#8221; something out, it&#8217;s like you are voiding it, revoking it, calling it off. You&#8217;re <em>canceling</em> it. This sense, which we still use today, comes about by the 1500s.</p>\n<p>In the 2010s,\u00a0<em>canceled</em> took on some big-time social connotations. It\u2019s being used to declare people null and void, like my ex-friend, Jessica.</p>\n<p><em>Canceling</em>, today, is used like an informal\u00a0boycott,\u00a0usually on social media, when someone or something in the public eye is offensive \u2026 or when we\u2019re just over them.</p>\n<p>Remember when Kanye West said &#8220;slavery was a choice&#8221; in 2018? Yeah, he got widely\u00a0<em>canceled\u00a0</em>for that. Meaning, people wanted others to stop buying his music and giving him a platform thanks to those &#8230; unusual &#8230; views.</p>\n<p>Calling for someone to be\u00a0<em>canceled</em>\u00a0in this way can be serious, and it&#8217;s become so common that we talk about a\u00a0<em>cancel culture</em>\u00a0online.</p>\n<p>But, we also often use <em>cancel</em> to be funny or dramatic. Like, if you get a flat tire on your way to work, you might cry out,\u00a0<em>Today is canceled</em>.</p>\n<p>Which makes me think &#8230; maybe we can all be too harsh and knee-jerk sometimes on social media. What if someone gets canceled before the whole story comes out? And, imagine feeling attacked and victimized by the entire internet? Rough.</p>\n[<em>Thoughtful pause and then picks back up the phone</em>]\u00a0On second thought, maybe we\u00a0should give Jessica a chance to explain.</p>\n[<em>Puts down phone and makes skeptical look</em>] Kanye, however &#8230;</p>\n",

It is. From an ancient Germanic root, <i>bosom</i> is recorded in Old English before the year 1000. Back then, the <i>bosom </i>was the breast of any human being\u2014not just well-endowed people of the female persuasion. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>To be in someone\u2019s bosom</i> is to be in their arms, hugged and held close to their heart, which we associate with deep feelings. That\u2019s why a <i>bosom friend</i>, a phrase found in the 16th century, is one you can confide in.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A modern version is <i>bosom buddy</i>, which comes about around the 1920s or so. That has nothing to do with milkshakes and bringing boys to the yard: it\u2019s all about affection and intimacy.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Those warm, fuzzy feelings are also why we see <i>bosom</i> in more poetic expressions, such as <i>the</i> <i>bosom of the earth</i> or <i>the</i> <i>bosom of the family. </i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">By the 1950s, though, <i>bosom</i> was specifically referring to a woman\u2019s breasts. We especially see it in the phrase <i>ample bosom</i>, or \u201clarge breasts.\u201d And, speaking of <i>breasts</i>, <i>bosoms</i>, in the plural, almost always means \u201ca woman\u2019s breasts.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Why would this old and much more general word <i>bosom </i>get narrowed down to female anatomy? I could venture to guess&#8230; [fake cough &#8211; says sexism under voice].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Besides, I feel like the more interesting questions is how was my grandma so strong back then?

Okay, let&#8217;s be real, no one exactly knows what <em>fleek </em>means, but that didn&#8217;t stop everyone from using it circa 2014.<br />\nThe first definition of <em>fleek </em>popped up on <em>Urban Dictionary </em>back in 2003 where it was said to mean &#8220;smooth, nice, and sweet.&#8221; Then, in 2009, the definition of &#8220;awesome&#8221; was added. So, <em>fleek </em>means something ambiguous but definitely good, right? Sure. How do we know? Well, it&#8217;s all thanks to one visionary 16-year-old Vine user named Kayla Lewis a.k.a. Peaches Monroee who described her eyebrows as <em>on fleek </em>in a legendary video back in 2014. Rest in peace, Vine. Lewis claims she just made the word up herself\u2014fleek just <em>sounds </em>like it should be a word, right?</p>\n<p>Anyway, the term went viral on Vine from Lewis&#8217; video and then was lapped up by millennials everywhere. Suddenly everything cool was <em>fleek</em>, for a couple years anyway. Kim Kardashian&#8217;s butt? <em>Fleek</em>. Taco Bell? <em>Fleek</em>. Steph Curry&#8217;s Sour Patch-inspired kicks? <em>Fleek</em>.</p>\n<p>But, like they did with diamonds, Hooter&#8217;s, and mayonnaise, millennials eventually killed <em>fleek</em>. And while it&#8217;s still kicking around some corners of the internet, almost no one describes stuff as <em>fleek </em>anymore. But that&#8217;s not going to stop me from admiring my look, thank you very much. And anyway, my eyebrows <em>are</em> on <em>fleek</em>. There&#8217;s no better word to describe them.</p>\n",

Uh &#8230; that&#8217;s awkward.</p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Sorry, I got a little carried away there. So, does <em>witch hunt</em> have anything to do with witches then or was I just completely off?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Phew, OK,\u00a0<em>w</em><em>itch</em><i> hunts</i> reached their height in Europe and North America in the 17th century, when we first have</span><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0record of the term </span><span class=\"s1\"><em>witch hunt.\u00a0</em>At this time, people blamed tragedies they didn\u2019t understand, such as babies dying or crops failing, on witches, who they believed had evil, magic powers.<br />\n</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Innocent people\u2014especially women, and often marginalized ones like slaves or widows\u2014were accused, tried, and killed for witchcraft. Historians estimate at least 40,000 people died because of <i>witch hunts</i>.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One of the most notorious <i>witch hunts</i> culminated in the 1692\u201393 Salem Witch Trials. Here, unexplained convulsions some young women were having led to mass hysteria in colonial Massachusetts about witchcraft. About 20 people were put to death as a result of the hearings, 14 of them women.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But, the term <i>witch hunt</i>, recorded as such in the late 1800s, took a turn in the early 20th century. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It became a metaphor for unrelenting efforts to drag down people considered disloyal or subversive in some way\u2014especially Communists. </span><span class=\"s1\">Amid the Cold War in the early 1950s, Senator Joseph McCarthy, for instance, ruthlessly targeted US citizens and government officials he alleged, without evidence, were Communists infiltrating the country.</span></p>\n<p>While the term\u00a0<em>witch hunt</em> in the early 20th century began to move away from the magical and misunderstood, it still kept with it\u00a0the lack of due process and proper &#8220;innocence before prove guilty,&#8221; making <em>witch hunt</em> a political and social metaphor in the modern era.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And now (well at least since January 2017), Donald Trump has been calling claims of possible collusion between his presidential campaign and the Russian government a <i>witch hunt</i>. And he doesn&#8217;t just use the phrase here and there. Trump has tweeted <i>witch hunt</i> literally hundreds of times, most memorably in May 2017 after the start of the special counsel investigation. He called it \u201cthe single greatest witch hunt of a politician American history.\u201d Hey what about those Salem Witch Trials we mentioned before?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Trump\u2019s<i> </i>use of<i> witch hunt </i>is<i> </i>rhetorical, but, it discredits our legal institutions. And, it downplays the fact that Russia interfered in our elections\u2014which is kind of big deal.\u00a0</span></p>\n",

Something nasty is in store for you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal of <em>karma</em> is to act as honorably as possible to ensure good things come your way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Hindus and other believers, <em>karma</em> is central to the cycle of <em>reincarnation</em>, or &#8220;the regeneration of a person\u2019s soul throughout different lives.&#8221;\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>To put it simply, bad <em>karma</em> means the soul gets reborn\u2014or <em>reincarnates</em>\u2014into a lower life form, like a bug. This explains why bad things happen to good people: They must have done something nasty in a past life.</p>\n<p>Good <em>karma</em> means the soul ultimately gets freed from physical bodies to become one with the universe in a state of bliss. Buddhists call this\u00a0<em>nirvana</em>.</p>\n<p>In everyday life and language, though,\u00a0<em>karma</em> is similar to expressions like <em>you reap what you sow</em>\u00a0or <em>you get what you deserve</em>.</p>\n<p>So, acting like a jerk? It&#8217;ll come back to haunt you.</p>\n",

The Rapture, for some Christians, is about the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. So, what exactly does \u201cecstasy\u201d have to do with \u201cend times?</p>\n<p>The key to understanding the wide-ranging rapture is its origin. It comes from a Latin verb, rapere [rah-puh-rey], which means \u201cto seize and carry off.\u201d Yes, this gives us the word rape. It also gives us rapture, literally a \u201csnatching up\u201d or \u201ckidnapping\u201d\u2014especially of women, which was one of the senses of rapture in the 1500\u20131600s.</p>\n<p>Ungodly stuff, for sure. So how is it that\u00a0rapture\u00a0is also related with the divine? Well, in the late 1300s, an older cousin of rapture, rapt, was used in Christian contexts to describe people, such as saints, who were carried up and away to heaven. Sometimes this was meant literally. Other times, this raptness referred to spiritual visions of God, as if in heaven.</p>\n<p>Intense experiences of delight and joy, of enthusiasm and absorption, can make one feel as though they have been \u201ctransported\u201d to some higher plane or \u201ctaken\u201d out of their body\u2014rapt. This metaphor is how we get rapture for \u201cjoyful ecstasy,\u201d like rapturous applause or the rapture of poetry and music.</p>\n<p>For some fundamentalist Christians starting in the 18th century, however, rapture is no metaphor. They think believers in Jesus will actually be \u201ccarried off\u201d\u2014again, think rapt\u2014in the sky to heaven to join Jesus Christ when he returns at the end of the world. This is called the Rapture, usually with a capital R.</p>\n<p>Hey, different things bring us joy in life. For some Christians? Their rapture is that \u201cJesus is coming.\u201d For me? My rapture is that \u201cWinter is coming.\u201d</p>\n",

That Beyonc\u00e9 is a queen, for example, is <em>manifest </em>to anyone who ever sees her perform.</p>\n<p>One popular use of <em>manifest\u00a0</em>as an adjective is:\u00a0<em>manifest destiny</em>? In the mid-1900s, this expressed the &#8220;clearly obvious&#8221; belief that the United States would\u2014and should\u2014continue to annex new territories.</p>\n<p>The phrase is credited to the journalist John O&#8217;Sullivan in 1845. To O&#8217;Sullivan, it was <em>manifest</em>, it was obvious and inevitable, that it was America&#8217;s <em>destiny</em> to expand.</p>\n<p><em>Manifest</em> is also found as verb around the late 1300s or so. It variously means &#8220;to show plainly, reveal, prove, or appear.&#8221; As in, my <em>Spotify manifests how much I love Beyonc\u00e9</em>. Or, ships <em>manifested</em> on the horizon.</p>\n<p>Speaking of ships &#8230; we have <em>manifest</em> as a noun. In the late 17th century, a <em>manifest</em> named an official list of a ship&#8217;s cargo. This was later extended to passengers, like on an airplane.</p>\n<p>This &#8220;ship inventory&#8221; sense of manifest was partly influenced by the Italian <em>manifesto</em>, which gives us, well, <em>manifesto</em>, &#8220;a public declaration or intentions, opinions, objectives, or motives,&#8221; such as issued by organizations or artists.</p>\n<p>The idea is that such a declaration is making the ideas &#8220;clear,&#8221; &#8220;evident,&#8221; &#8230; <em>manifest</em>, as I hope my little <em>manifesto</em> on <em>manifest</em> has done for you here.</p>\n",

But it could also mean &#8220;I love you like a friend.&#8221; Or even just, &#8220;you&#8217;re a nice person but I&#8217;m not that interested.&#8221; If it was a red heart emoji it would be so much clearer\u2014that definitely would mean they were into </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">me</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I haven&#8217;t even gotten to the worst part yet.

You know, just to say &#8220;rock on.&#8221; And you&#8217;ll never guess what they said back.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They said &#8220;um\u2026did you just say you love me?&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the &#8220;sign of horns&#8221; emoji looks like &#8220;I love you&#8221; in American Sign Language.

And, better yet, you don\u2019t have to take them outside to go to the bathroom.</p>\n<p>My uncle, on the other hand, is a dog person. He likes that his dog is loyal, comes running when he calls, and just &#8230; generally pays attention to him.</p>\n<p>Whereas cats ignore you when you talk to them, look unimpressed at your attempts to play, and are nowhere to be found when you come home from work.</p>\n<p>He calls them\u00a0aloof.</p>\n<p>Aloof\u00a0can be an adverb, meaning\u00a0\u201cat a distance, especially in feeling or interest.\u201d It can also be an adjective, meaning \u201creserved or reticent.\u201d Yeah, I had to look that word reticent up, too. It means &#8220;restrained,&#8221; which, yes, my cat is.</p>\n<p>As for aloof, it started out on the last place my cat would want to be: on the sea. Back in the 1500s,\u00a0aloof was a nautical term referring to keeping a ship close to the wind. The a-\u00a0part means &#8220;in&#8221; or &#8220;on&#8221; and the loof part\u00a0comes from a Middle English word that had the sense of &#8220;windward.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sailing ship in this way helped kept it clear of any land it could drift into. It&#8217;s like the ship is keeping its distance. See the connection here?</p>\n<p>By the\u00a01600s, aloof\u00a0spread as a metaphor for &#8220;distant,&#8221; &#8220;disinterested,&#8221; or &#8220;uninvolved,&#8221; often in a cold, unfriendly way.</p>\n<p>But listen&#8230; it&#8217;s really just an act. At night, when no one is looking, my seemingly disinterested cat is always curled up on top of me. Sure, it may just be because I am warm and not because she loves me&#8230; but whatever, I&#8217;ll take what I can get.</p>\n",

That&#8217;s it. Not so complicated, right?</p>\n<p>OK, next up: <em>accept</em> or <em>except</em>.</p>\n<p>I like all of the characters in <em>Stranger Things</em> ____ Barb, who I absolutely love.</p>\n<p>The answer is:\u00a0<em>except</em>.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a hot tip, one easy way to keep these two terms straight is to\u00a0remember\u00a0the<i>\u00a0ex-</i>\u00a0in\u00a0<em>except\u00a0</em>and associate it with\u00a0<i>exclude</i>. Barb is excluded from the other characters here because she&#8217;s the best.</p>\n<p>Alright, we&#8217;ve arrived at our bonus question: <em>blond</em> or <em>blonde</em>?</p>\n<p>Yup, there are two spellings in case you didn&#8217;t already know. So when do you use each?</p>\n<p>The woman&#8217;s hair was _____.</p>\n<p>The answer is:\u00a0<em>blonde</em>.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s why. When the word\u00a0<em>blonde</em> came over into the English language (from French) it was gendered:\u00a0<em>blonde\u00a0</em>was used for women with light hair and\u00a0<em>blond</em> was used for men with light hair. Weirdly, English kept this gendering &#8230; even though we don&#8217;t have other gendered words. Maybe it&#8217;s time to get rid of this gendered distinction &#8230; right, English?</p>\n",

A high-school principal may not be a very well-respected profession, but she recognized it as a chance to influence the young minds of the next generation and to maybe inspire change early on instead of trying to change things after they&#8217;ve happened.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s her story:</p>\n<p>By definition, I am a high school principal. I do all of the daily administrative tasks that you would assume a principal does. But to me, it&#8217;s so much more. My name is Kendra Carr, and I&#8217;m the high school principal of Holy Names High School, an all girls Catholic school in Oakland, California.</p>\n<p>I initially pursued a career in law, thinking that that&#8217;s how I would make the most impact on the world. But after an internship, working with young people at a high school in South Africa, I realized that education is where I could make the most change.</p>\n<p>As a school community committed to service, justice, developing the next generation of leaders, we are really intentional about creating a space here on campus where students come in and discover who they are. When a freshman comes, she uses words that are very different than what a senior uses upon graduation. When a freshman enters, she is timid, she is unsure of herself, she&#8217;s trying to find her place. When a senior talks about herself, she really has become comfortable in her skin. She uses words like <em>impact</em> and <em>purpose</em> and <em>passion</em>. When I hear words like <em>I can&#8217;t</em> or <em>that&#8217;s impossible</em>, or <em>it&#8217;s too hard</em>, or <em>that&#8217;s not me</em>, I remind them that anything is possible. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re here.</p>\n<p>Our school motto is Noblesse Oblige. It&#8217;s Latin\u00a0and means &#8220;to whom much is given, much is required.&#8221; That&#8217;s a motto I really try to live by and instill in the minds of these young women.</p>\n<p>But, they&#8217;ve also taught me things too. I&#8217;ve learned terms like <em>dab</em>, <em>bae</em> is a big one, my bae, you know, my bestie. Oh, <em>tried it</em>, tried it, we all know what<em> tried it</em> means. But it&#8217;s when someone is basically posturing and trying to be someone who they&#8217;re not, and you have to call them out. Say, &#8220;You tried it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>They&#8217;ve taught me <em>blim</em>. It&#8217;s something on social media where someone disses another person. <em>Blim</em> is short for subliminal messages, which is a comment directed at someone that doesn&#8217;t specifically name them. You know what? I have to blims in disciplinary conversations because cyberbullying unfortunately is a reality that we deal with now. It&#8217;s a precise way to identify to a student what it is that she&#8217;s done to disrespect her sister.</p>\n<p>Education has the power to truly change a young person&#8217;s trajectory because young people have a vision. They believe in peace. They believe in justice. They believe in inclusivity. We can have the most impact on the future by supporting the visions of young people. My words matter because as a high-school principal I am an agent of change.</p>\n",

My favorite thing about being a writer is that I get to do it all the time, and make a living off of it, which is really the dream! One of the reasons that I&#8217;m here and I&#8217;m able to do this for work is that I had a really significant teacher in my life. That teacher&#8217;s name is Ryan Gobel. He was my sophomore year English teacher. He had a really inventive and engaging and unique teaching style. Um, and he interacted with us like, um, in a more, I don&#8217;t know, collegial kind of way, which was great and the first time that had ever happened to me. What he mostly did is he encouraged me to take my writing seriously, as something that was worthy of my time and worthy of attention.</p>\n<p>My seventh grade English teacher, Mrs. June P. Garrett, at Signal Mountain Junior High School in Signal Mountain, Tennessee. Mrs. Garrett loved to laugh, and I liked to write funny essays whenever I had a homework assignment. And she liked what I wrote so much, she wrote in the margins of one of my papers, &#8220;You will make your living as a writer someday!&#8221;</p>\n<p>I was a daily writer for a very long time, and it grew into a book that&#8217;s called Maid and it has been translated into, I think, maybe twelve languages. Most of my English teachers have, in some way, given me something. Uh, you know, Mrs. Book from fifth and sixth grade, Mrs. Strasnefski in high school. Uh, but the really, the one teacher I think who uh imprinted me most significantly is probably uh Doctor Kobre, Mike Kobre, a professor of mine in college.

It was something that was looked down upon because women were judged based on whether they were married and who they were married to.</p>\n<p>If women chose not to marry, then they were referred to as\u00a0<em>spinsters</em>? Which is a kind of funny, nasty-sounding, derogatory term that just meant they were women who chose not to be married and were past the age of marrying. Whatever that means.</p>\n<p>But, I think that we need to reclaim the word\u00a0<em>single</em>\u00a0for our time. Because it is not the 14th century anymore, and nobody has to feel ashamed of not getting married.</p>\n<p>I mean, today we can think of\u00a0<em>single\u00a0</em>in a positive light. Giving yourself your\u00a0<em>single,\u00a0</em>undivided attention, so that you can really show yourself some love.

He wanted to build a tower out of zig-zag blocks.</p>\n<p>The problem was he didn\u2019t understand what <em>zig-zagging</em> meant.</p>\n<p>He was building things with staircases in it, and all kinds of different shapes, but it wasn\u2019t zig-zagging.</p>\n<p>I couldn\u2019t figure out how to tell him what it meant.</p>\n<p>Then, I remembered that one of his favorite books is <em>Little Green</em>. And, in <em>Little Green</em> is the story of a hummingbird in the garden, and the hummingbird is flying up and flying down, and towards you and away, and zig-zagging from flower to flower.</p>\n<p>So, once I re-read that story to him he understood what <em>zig-zagging</em> was supposed to be, and he was finally able to build his own little tower.</p>\n<p>And he did a really great job on it too &#8230; but it wasn\u2019t as tall as my tower.</p>\n</div>\n",

We kid, we kid. For another, they both have <em>clout</em>. They both have a great deal of &#8220;influence.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Today, the slang\u00a0<em>clout</em> is like a mix of popularity and power on social media. If Kylie Jenner posts a pic of herself wearing, say, a pink mini-dress, you better believe her millions of followers going to want it. She&#8217;s an influencer.</p>\n<p>Trump also wields a lot of power online, but he&#8217;s, well, the president. His <em>clout\u00a0</em>calls backs to an earlier sense of\u00a0<em>clout</em> that specifically referred to &#8220;political influence.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The political\u00a0<em>clout</em> has been found in the 1860s. It packs a punch\u2014literally. The slang is thought to come from an older <em>clout</em>, found in the 14th century, meaning &#8220;a heavy blow.&#8221;\u00a0Having <em>clout</em>, then, is like being a heavy hitter.</p>\n<p>If we go back even earlier to Old English, <em>clout</em>\u00a0was a mere rag, like a scrap of <em>cloth</em> or other material. That&#8217;s a far cry from Jenner&#8217;s dresses.\u00a0Perhaps the &#8220;punch&#8221; sense of <em>clout</em> comes from some idea of a &#8220;lump&#8221; of something?</p>\n<p>Whatever the case, fashion may have helped bring <em>clout</em> into the slang of the 2010s. In a 2017, rapper Denzel Curry dubbed a pair of white, round sunglasses\u2014the same kind grunge legend Kurt Cobain donned in the 1990s\u2014<em>Clout Goggles</em> in a YouTube video. (show clip of video-\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsWy5X9xIEk)</p>\n<p>Curry, and other rappers wearing the sunglasses, has cred. He has swag.

It was especially promoted by a Norfolk Island resident named Isaac Robinson, who acted as an American consul on the island.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Since there aren&#8217;t really turkeys in the South Pacific, Norfolk Islanders instead feast on pork, chicken, Tahitian fish salad, and bananas. Like, so many bananas.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The churches on the island are loaded up their agricultural bounty, which is then sold as a fundraiser. After services, there&#8217;s a massive feast.

It was what, uh, came out of it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Back in the 1400\u20131500s, <i>squirt</i> could mean \u201cdiarrhea.\u201d It\u2019s one of the oldest recorded senses we have of the word, and it\u2019s why we call it <i>the squirts</i>. That, and the whole liquid, uh\u2014I think you get the picture.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We don\u2019t know where the word <i>squirt</i> comes from, exactly. And honestly, I\u2019m fine with that. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Now, the good news is that <i>squirt</i> can do double duty (sorry) if you want to poke fun at your kid brother by calling him <i>a little squirt</i>. It\u2019s the smallness of a <i>squirt</i> that made it an insult, originally, back in the 1800s.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The bad news is that you\u2019re never gonna think about a <i>squirt gun\u2014</i>or a<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span>bottle of ketchup\u2014the same way again.</span></p>\n",

But, whenever I hear about someone making \u201ccandid remarks,\u201d I know things got <em>real</em>. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Let me be <i>candid</i> with you. It can be hard tell whether being <i>candid</i> is a good or bad thing.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Candid</i> comes from the Latin <i>candidus</i> [<b>kahn</b>-di-duhs], which means \u201cshiny white.\u201d Words like <i>candle</i> and <i>incandescent</i> are related. So is <i>candidate</i>, as ancient Romans wore white togas during election campaigns. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Candid</i> as \u201cwhite\u201d<i> </i>became a metaphor for \u201cpure,\u201d \u201cjust\u201d,\u201d and \u201csincere\u201d in English when it was borrowed in the late 17th century. It also was extended to traits like \u201chonest,\u201d \u201csincere,\u201d and \u201cfrank.\u201d\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">These are all virtuous and attractive qualities, right? We don\u2019t like it when people are\u00a0 fronting or being fake. Remember that show <i>Candid Camera</i>? It caught people in genuine moments\u2014not pretend&#8230; also not always pretty.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But, the truth can hurt. In recent decades, especially in politics and journalism, we\u2019ve really taken to the word <i>candid</i> to mean \u201cfrank,\u201d that is, \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201cunreserved,\u201d especially about difficult topics. A <i>candid</i> interview with a celebrity tackles tough and personal questions. A <i>candid</i> discussion in the Oval Office doesn\u2019t sugarcoat reality. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And, for as much as a <i>candid</i> photograph means a person is unposed and informal, it can also be unflattering. Why do you think we all spend so much time perfecting our selfies?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So, is <i>candid </i>good or bad? We value when people, especially politicians, don\u2019t b.s. us, but facing the facts is very challenging and uncomfortable. Again, I have to be <i>candid</i> with you. It&#8217;s a little bit of both, because this word isn\u2019t so black\u2026or white. </span></p>\n",

[laughs] It\u2019s something about how explosive it is coming off of the tongue. Persnickety is an adjective and it\u2019s usually describing someone that, um, tends to be placing too much emphasis on trivial or minor details. Someone who\u2019s really fussy or picky. One of the best ways to use it in a sentence is: \u201cI have a friend who\u2019s really persnickety about their food and so they won\u2019t eat bananas.\u201d [laughs] They\u2019re, you know, the people who have the texture thing, which I never quite get.

As far as I could see, there were people, no matter which direction I looked: masses and masses of people, and everything was just fine.\n\nJeanne P. B. : It was just mind-blowing to see how many people were packed into this particular ... You know, we've taken that road hundreds and hundreds of times before that, and you know, you just passed Yasgur farms, and you see that beautiful red barn and that scene is gorgeous. And to see it that way, you know, it's just sort of emblazoned in your memory. It's just so different and \u2026 but it's amazing that it happened.\n\nTravis Broxton: Just to see the expanse of people just kind of blew me away. Hey, you know, I'm trying to be cool. You know, I don't, you know \u2026 never let them see you sweat. But I was like, \"Man oh man, where are we going to eat?\" [laughs]\n\nGlenn Wooddell: The intentions of the Food For Love people was that we would serve food and beverage for the entire festival. You know, if you know the history of Woodstock, everything was altered or \u2026 and canceled because of the, um, horrendous thunderstorms that we had from the second day, on and off. So, we were actually only open and in full swing an afternoon, an evening, and the beginning of the next morning.\n\nJason Stone: Every five minutes, there was another rumor going around at \u2026 at the original Woodstock. And those rumors were everything, uh, uh down to: You can't get in, you can't get out. The highways are closed. It's impossible. It'll take you five hours to get out of here. There's no water, there's no facilities. It's a disaster area. They're sending in the National Guard. Just about anything and everything that could be a rumor was said that day, and it didn't matter\u2014because we were all there and we were all together and we were all one.\n\nJanice I.: The chain-link fence: I can still look down and see this chain-link fence on the ground, and thinking \u201cThere's no barrier to keep people out!\u201d I'd not experienced that before. And what a wonderful thing that it was just \u201cCome!\u201d\n\nJohn M. : But, Woodstock was all about all of these people cooperating and getting through that weekend together. And, what they say, there was one birth and one death, and it was a universe of its own. And, it will never be repeated again. But, you know, of course, for a new generation they become new festivals for their music, but there'll never be another Woodstock.\n\nSteve Alexander: The life-changer for me, of course, was looking back and realizing: Here was about a million people gathered together, no fights, nobody was grappling over who had what. Everybody shared everything. There was peace in the air. People were joyful about the music. They were joyful about where they were and who they were with. And we looked around and for the first time in our lives, living the kind of lifestyle we were as hippies, freaks\u2014call us what you will. We see \u2026 we could see a lot of us. And we could see a lot of us around us and, and in the crowd and in the eyes of the people that were there.\n\nPhilip R. : Woodstock was the first time I actually felt that I belonged to a group. It was an awakening for me to realize that there were half a million, three hundred and ... three-quarters of a million people just like me with the same attitudes towards life. So for that reason, it changed my life at that time. All of a sudden, I felt like I belonged to something, uh, which was later termed the Woodstock Generation.\n\nGraham Nash : The lead-up to to Woodstock was kind of interesting. You know, we, uh, we knew that we were gonna play \u2026 but when we committed to doing it, there were supposedly like 25,000 people gonna be there. And then, you know, two weeks before that there was 100,000 people gonna be there. And then a week before they were 250,000 people gonna be there. And the day of the show? Lotta people.\n\nGraham Nash : When we first saw the amount of people that were there, we kind of had a little trepidation about doing a song like \u201cGuinnevere,\u201d for instance, which is just one guitar and two voices. But I believe our experience, particularly mine with The Hollies, you know, we had a, a bunch of hit records before I ever met David and Stephen. And, and David's experience with The Byrds, and Steven's experience and, uh, Neil's experience with the Buffalo Springfield, probably put us in good stead for handling a crowd of that size.\n\nGraham Nash : And what you do, kind of, is concentrate on the first, you know, 20 or so rows that you can actually see, you know, and then try and project, knowing that, you know, the 300th, 400th thousandth person can hear you just as well as the people on the front row. And that's something that we had to learn to do, and we had to learn to do that very quickly.\n\nRube Goldberg : The, uh, stage itself was a Rube Goldberg event. The catwalk to the stage was something",

                    "transcript": "<p>Hi. I&#8217;m April Reign, the creator of OscarsSoWhite.</p>\n<p>In January of 2015, I was still a practicing attorney, um, and I had no connection whatsoever to the entertainment field, other than the fact that I was a rabid consumer of film. Uh, so the Oscars particularly were like my Super Bowl. There were special snacks involved. I&#8217;d rope off the TV so everybody knew this was mommy&#8217;s night. I&#8217;d watch the pre-show, the show, the after show, the show the next day. Everything about the Oscars I loved.</p>\n<p>Uh, so I was&#8230; That morning, January 2015, I was watching the nominations on one of the morning television shows, and it just struck me for no particular reason that year because, unfortunately, it happened both before then and since, um, there were no people of color nominated in any of the acting categories. 20 different spots. So I picked up my phone, um, which is typically embedded in my forearm, and got on social media and tweeted, &#8220;OscarsSoWhite they asked to touch my hair.&#8221; And that was it. I then went on to work, uh, and then when I checked in on Twitter around lunchtime, the hashtag based on that one tweet was then trending internationally.</p>\n<p>Um, as I said, this was a very organic campaign, I guess. I wasn&#8217;t even planning for it to be a campaign or a movement initially. Uh, I was just thinking out loud. (laughs) Very often, I think out loud on Twitter to share my thoughts, um, with my followers and whoever is interested.</p>\n<p>I know generally, having had hashtags go internationally viral both before OscarsSoWhite and since, that hashtags have to be short, um, first and foremost. You know, in January of 2015, we were still relegated to 140 characters, not the 280 that we have now, uh, so every single letter, every single word or phrase matters. Um, and so I knew that OscarsSoWhite was short. I was hoping that it was to the point, (laughs) even though, um, years later, people still pretend at least to misunderstand what my meaning was with that phrase. Um, and I was hoping that it would be memorable. And, in fact, it was. Uh, and so now, um, here we are now in year six of OscarsSoWhite, and people are still using the hashtag. And, in fact, um, the phrase has broadened. You know, now there is a JournalismSoWhite and an EducationSoWhite and even a BrooklynSoWhite, none of which I started, um, I think that goes to show that, um, when you are doing something that makes sense that can be universal, and that&#8217;s what you want a hashtag to be, people may take it and riff off of it, um, to make it their own, and then I think that&#8217;s great.</p>\n<p>Um, so hashtags sh- should be short, they should be to the point, um, they should ensure that your message is getting across in just that one phrase, um, and hopefully they are memorable.</p>\n<p>To people who are interested in creating their own viral movements or campaigns, um, you know, I would say you can absolutely start on social media, but don&#8217;t stay there. Um, remember that there are people who don&#8217;t use social media (laughs), surprisingly enough, uh, so you need to meet people where they are. Hashtags are great for getting a conversation going, and hopefully that conversation will continue, even if you&#8217;re not leading it. Um, but you also need to write. You need to speak. Um, i- but if you have an issue that touches your heart, um, something that you feel passionate about, um, something that you want to see changed, absolutely get on social media, regardless of the size of your platform, and start talking about it using that hashtag, and then get your friends, family, and followers involved, um, to help you with your campaign. Good luck.</p>\n",

Uh, obviously that, that lead to me wanting to become an English teacher.</p>\n<p>ANGIE: Hi, Dictionary.com, this is Angie Thomas, the author of <em>The Hate U Give</em> and <em>On The Come Up</em>. I started loving language when I first fell in love with hip-hop music. One thing that people don\u2019t give rappers enough credit for is their ability to use language and to use words to, not only convey their thoughts and their feelings, but to create images.</p>\n<p>JAKE: But, yeah, I\u2019m really annoying with words. That\u2019s definitely the case.</p>\n<p>KRISTEN: Ok, so my favorite word is <em>vitriol</em>. It literally means &#8220;sulfuric acid,&#8221; but over time the British, I think, adapted it to start using it to refer to negative and/or critical speech. I just really like it because instead of saying, \u201cHey, you\u2019re being a negative Nancy\u201d, you can say, \u201cHey Nancy, you\u2019re being vitriolic af right now. Ya gotta cut it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>ANGIE: My absolute favorite word actually ended up becoming the name of a character in my book, <em>The Hate U Give</em>, and that word is <em>maverick</em>. I absolutely love that word and what it means and what it stands for and just how powerful it sounds.</p>\n<p>JAKE: I think my absolute favorite word is <em>mellifluous</em>. I also like <em>cacophony</em>. Kinda the opposite.</p>\n<p>LAURA: On Dictionary.com the feature that I find myself using the most, uh, is the pronunciation guide. I am a middle school English teacher and the last thing I wanna do in front of my students is pronounce one of their vocabulary words incorrectly.</p>\n<p>SELENA &amp; LOGAN\u2019S MOM: And what is your favorite thing about Dictionary.com?</p>\n<p>SELENA &amp; LOGAN: Word of the Day, Word of the Day, what\u2019s gonna be the Word of the day? Ma! [giggles]\n<p>LAURA: The last thing I looked up on Dictionary.com, uh, were the, uh, the two words <em>flotsam</em> and <em>jetsam</em>. Uh, this came about because I was watching <em>The Little Mermaid</em> with my three-year-old daughter and, if you\u2019re not familiar with the story of <em>The Little Mermaid</em>, uh, there\u2019s Queen Ursula, the sea witch. She has two sidekicks, they\u2019re eels, and their names are Flotsam and Jetsam, a term for describing floating debris or wreckage from a ship.</p>\n<p>JAKE: I looked up the word <em>treason</em>, uh, because it\u2019s being thrown around Washington quite a bit.</p>\n<p>ANGIE: The last thing I looked up in the dictionary was the word <em>aw</em>. And the reason I looked it up was because I\u2019m using it as I\u2019m working on my book, and I wasn\u2019t sure if you use one <em>W</em> or two <em>W</em>s. I\u2019m so used to seeing it with two, but I was pretty sure that you only use one.</p>\n<p>KRISTEN: So, the coolest word that I\u2019ve ever learned on Dictonary.com is <em>xx</em>. It turns out that it\u2019s an abbreviation for <em>sugar</em>. Um, baker\u2019s, back in the day when they had to write out all their recipes by hand, they would write <em>xx</em>\u00a0instead of <em>sugar</em>.</p>\n<p>SELENA &amp; LOGAN\u2019S MOM: Logan, what\u2019s your coolest word?</p>\n<p>LOGAN: <em>Contronym</em>.</p>\n<p>SELENA &amp; LOGAN\u2019S MOM: What\u2019s a <em>contronym</em>?</p>\n<p>LOGAN: It has two meanings of opposites.</p>\n<p>SELENA &amp; LOGAN\u2019S MOM: Can you think of an example of a <em>contronym</em>?</p>\n<p>LOGAN: No. Wait. Are we <em>contronym</em>? Sometimes?</p>\n<p>SELENA &amp; LOGAN\u2019S MOM: I hope my children aren\u2019t <em>contronyms</em>!</p>\n<p>LOGAN: Wait, I re- I remember one! <em>Cleave</em>! <em>Cleave</em>! <em>Cleave</em>! <em>Cleave</em>! <em>Cleave</em>!</p>\n<p>SELENA &amp; LOGAN\u2019S MOM: You\u2019re gonna <em>cleave</em> to each other?</p>\n<p>SELENA &amp; LOGAN: <em>Cleave</em>! <em>Cleave</em>!</p>\n<p>SELENA &amp; LOGAN: I\u2019m a Dictionary.com wordie!</p>\n",

You might feel a little existential when you're starting to wonder what it is you want to do with life, or what it is life is all about.\nSpeaker 2: To be, to exist, to think. To do things, nice things, like to create stuff. To do more than just pay bills.\nSpeaker 3: Human existence, freedom.\nSpeaker 4: It means that we work our whole lives in a job that we hate, so that we can still pad our deathbed with all of the regrets and remorse of our time on this planet.\nSpeaker 5: The human existence, particularly as it relates to free will and the futility of existence without action and forethought and decision on the part of human beings.\nSpeaker 1: To me, the best use of the word existential is when you are describing an existential crisis. For me, personally, growing up, I was always very confused and weirded out by these very strong gender norms around me. I went through this whole existential crisis trying to figure out what is it about me that is so different from all these people? Eventually I was able to work through this existential crisis and I was meeting new people and discovering new things about myself, and it turns out I'm non-binary.\nSpeaker 2: The fact that I exist and I am aware of it make me think and act to accommodate that. So, I want to exist to be significant. I become anxious because I want to fulfill this existence, and then I'm wondering if I will be able to do something, if I will be able to exist for real. I know I'm here, but to the full purpose of it. Sometimes it give me really bad anxiety.\nSpeaker 1: While things might feel heavy and confusing in this existential experience, it's not always a bad thing. You can use things that you have learned from this existential crisis, of digging deep and really trying to pinpoint what it is you want in life and what it is life can mean to you.\nSpeaker 4: It's looking for truth and it's looking your fellow man in the eye and talking to people, We've got to still hold each other up. That's how you cut that dragon's head off.\nSpeaker 6: Do you know what existential means?\nSpeaker 7: No idea.\nSpeaker 6: Do you know what existence means?\nSpeaker 7: That means your life.\nSpeaker 6: Yeah, okay. Existential is relating to existence.\nSpeaker 7: Fart.\nSpeaker 6: So, when we talk about existentialism-\nSpeaker 7: Fart. Fart.\nSpeaker 6: I guess when you're five, everything relates back to that, doesn't it?",

When the 1980s rolled around, this meant \u201ccomputers,\u201d which were super technical at the time.</p>\n<p>But, by the 2000s, geek and nerd were seeing more and more popularity, shall we say. For one thing, all of us were on computers nonstop and watching the latest Avengers flick. For another, we were priding ourselves on our pet passions. We were rejecting the idea that being really into something means you are a geek or nerd.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why we call ourselves beer nerds if we love hunting down the best craft IPA or football geeks if we know all the stats in the game\u2014things more stereotypically associated with jocks thanks dorks, right?</p>\n<p>Now, don\u2019t just go calling anyone a straight-up geek or nerd to make fun of them. That\u2019s still uncool. But calling yourself one? That\u2019s cool. Trust us. We\u2019re word nerds, after all.</p>\n",

Now, there\u2019s a lot of things that come to mind around this time of year. You know, it\u2019s cold outside, maybe it\u2019s snowing, and people are coming together with their friends and their families to celebrate and exchange gifts and presents. But there\u2019s one word that always comes to mind, and that\u2019s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cheer</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

I really like the word </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eggnog</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> around Christmastime because it\u2019s just such a festive drink that really just divides families.

I\u2019m not kidding. Because I used to imagine my toes had missiles on them, and I was shooting people under my desk, like da-da-da-da-da [explosion noise], in my head and making the sound effects out loud. But the word </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mistletoe</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, being a noun, it&#8211;actually , it\u2019s something. It\u2019s a parasitic plant that attaches itself to trees and shrubs.

And if so what are they?</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a little stroll down Christmas Carol lane to find out &#8230;</p>\n<p>First up: The 12 days of Christmas are not the 12 days <em>leading</em> <em>up</em> to Christmas. In Christian tradition, the roughly four-week period before Christmas Day is actually called <em>Advent</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Advent</em> means &#8220;arrival,&#8221; referring to the coming of Jesus Christ to the world, which is celebrated on December 25th: Christmas Day.</p>\n<p>For Christians, the 12 Days of Christmas start either on or the day after Christmas. Fun fact: Christmas Day marks the <em>Nativity</em>. <em>Nativity</em> means &#8220;birth,&#8221; and Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus on this day.</p>\n<p>OK that was a lot &#8230; but basically this all means that the 12 Days of Christmas go to December 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, January 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and January 6th.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s so special about January 6th? That&#8217;s the feast of the <em>Epiphany</em>. <em>Epiphany</em>, here, means &#8220;manifestation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In Christian belief, Jesus Christ was manifested\u2014or &#8220;revealed&#8221;\u2014as the son of God to the world in the form of the Three Wise Men, or Magi.</p>\n<p>The Epiphany is also called the <em>Theophany</em>. That&#8217;s a &#8220;revelation of God to a person.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Now, as I noted, the Epiphany is the 12th and final day of Christmas. So, it also goes by &#8230; <em>Twelfth Day</em>.</p>\n<p>The night before may have a familiar name to you as well: <em>Twelfth Night</em>.<em>\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>I guess this my chance celebrate (cough, cough to take off of work) until the <em>Twelfth Day</em> this year &#8230; right?</p>\n",

Uh, if your friends are anything like mine, they\u2019re going to get pretty tired of hearing you constantly say, \u201cI\u2019m cold. I\u2019m cold!\u201d So, here are some ways to switch it up and continue complaining about the weather using different words.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, my favorite winter word and my favorite homophone is chilly</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">chilly</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">chili</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chilly</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as in \u201ccold,\u201d and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">chili</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as the most delicious meal that goes with cinnamon rolls&#8211;ever. So, a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">homophone</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is where two words that are pronounced the exact same have two different meanings, like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">right</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as in your </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">right</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> hand, or </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">write</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">write</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. [gestures writing] You know, it\u2019s so funny when people say </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">chilly</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I feel as though, that whenever you\u2019re describing how cold it is, you\u2019re gonna be usually in a calmer, more happier mood, more mellow mood, if you describe it as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">chilly</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might also say something like, \u201cIt\u2019s a little crisp outside, it feels a little crisp.\u201d You know, if it\u2019s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">crisp</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you might step outside, take a deep breath, [breathes in] and the air feels a little, it feels kind of sharp entering your lungs and against your skin.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s no other way to describe it other than it\u2019s just, really </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">frosty</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> weather. There\u2019s different kinds of cold, right? There\u2019s, like, the really windy cold. But, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">frosty</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> makes me think: snow. Right? </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frosty</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the Snowman. It\u2019s a wet kind of cold where you just feel it in your bones.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or, you know, maybe it\u2019s snowing outside, or it just snowed, or it\u2019s just cold enough that everything\u2019s covered in frost, which is pretty much just a thin layer of ice.

We\u2019re playing the ole \u201chandsome\u2014egg\u201d angle, because this is how a word like brooding can span \u201cintrospection\u201d and \u201cincubation.\u201d</p>\n<p>When someone is brooding, they are \u201cpreoccupied with depressing, morbid, or painful memories or thoughts.\u201d We swoon for certain celebrities, like a Ryan Gosling, who have a brooding look. They look serious, moody, hurt, lost in thought.</p>\n<p>Brooding comes from a 16th-century verb\u00a0brood, which is \u201cto dwell or meditate on\u201d some difficult or dark subject. I, for one, brood over the fact that Ryan Gosling doesn\u2019t respond to my tweets \u2026 or my Instagrams \u2026 or Facebook messages \u2026 or my letters.</p>\n<p>The original brooders, though,\u00a0are birds. They sit on their eggs so as to hatch them\u2014they brood their eggs, a sense of the word found in the 1400s.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re dealing with metaphor here! A bird brooding eggs is a like a person sitting on some emotion for a long time\u2014not unlike how we nurse anger or resentment, as if keeping those feelings warm and holding them close like a bird does its eggs.</p>\n<p>Brooding darkness, meanwhile, hovers heavily over us. This use of\u00a0brooding is like how nighttime can overhang us as a mother bird does over its nest.</p>\n<p>Now, the verb brood comes from the noun brood, recorded as early as the year 1000 for \u201cthe offspring of animals that lay eggs,\u201d like reptiles, insects, and, especially, birds. This is why we sometimes joke about a large family as a brood.</p>\n<p>Our noun\u00a0brood is hatched from the Old English\u00a0br\u00f3d [brohd], which comes from an ancient Germanic root meaning \u201cto warm\u201d or \u201cheat&#8221;. So yeah, in other words, this means that when we call Ryan Gosling brooding, we are also literally calling him \u201chot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hey Ryan &#8211; I just liked your latest post on Instagram!

A lot of people believe that Hanukkah is a Jewish law type of holiday, like all of the other Jewish holidays, it is not. It is not even in the Torah. It is completely customary because of word of mouth history that as been passed down.</p>\n<p>Speaker 1: Another word that comes to mind is winter, because it usually comes around Christmas time for Hanukkah, so that&#8217;s why you&#8217;ll see people celebrating Hanukkah or saying happy holidays instead of Merry Christmas, because there are Jews out here, and we are out here, we would like to be recognized to.</p>\n<p>Speaker 2: This third word is miracle, and I think that word is really indicative of what Hanukkah is.</p>\n<p>Speaker 1: In the original story of Hanukkah, there were candles that they had to light and make last for longer than the amount of wax that they had, and it was only supposed to last one day and they didn&#8217;t even have enough for that, and by miracle it ended up lasting for eight whole days.</p>\n<p>Speaker 3: Number four is latkes, we make latkes, they&#8217;re little potato circles that you make with the oil, and they&#8217;re very delicious.</p>\n<p>Speaker 2: And that is food that people traditionally eat on Hanukkah, and I love eating latkes with applesauce.</p>\n<p>Speaker 1: Another word that comes to mind when I think of Hanukkah is dreidel. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever seen a dreidel, it&#8217;s a little top spinner. It&#8217;s a little, sort of gambling game that they played way back in the time of Hanukkah. Fun fact, the four letters are nun, gimel, he, shin, nes, gadol, haya, sham. That means a big miracle happened there, to signify the eight days that the candle stayed lit.</p>\n",

For instance, maybe you\u2019re thinking, \u201cThis year, I want to get published!\u201d That would be awesome! But, it\u2019s not always in our control whether we get published or not. A more attainable goal, and better way to phrase this, might be, \u201cThis year, I am going to submit my manuscript 50 times to 50 different publishers.\u201d That way, you can meet your goal because it is dependent on whether you get up and you follow through on submitting the manuscript. And if you get published, that\u2019s just a cherry on top. Set deadlines for yourself, and physically put in your planner when you are going to write. If you want to write, you have to make time for it. At least, that\u2019s the way it works for me. I\u2019m never gonna write if I don\u2019t sit down and say, \u201cOK, I\u2019m gonna make time to write at this time today, for this long.\u201d So physically put your writing time in your planner.

Your second thing is, what\u2019s your achievable goal?

It is a spinning top that is used, um, during the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the dreidel, there are four letters: a nun, and these are Hebrew letters. A nun, a gimel, a hei, and a shin. And each one of these letters represents a word. So nun, nes, \u201cmiracle.\u201d Gimel, \u201cguh, guh,\u201d gimel, stands for gadol, the word gadol, which is \u201cbig,\u201d or \u201cgreat,\u201d in this case. Hei, haya. Haya means \u201cwas\u201d or \u201chappened.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then this is always really interesting which I love. So here in the United States, or anywhere outside of Israel, in fact, your dreidel will say, will have a shin. It stands for sham, which means \u201cthere.\u201d But if you bought your dreidel in Israel, it&#8217;ll have a \u201cpuh,\u201d a pe. It\u2019ll have a pe. And the pe stands for poh. The word poh means \u201chere,\u201d cause the miracle happened there. So, here in the US or anywhere outside of Israel, you would say, \u201ca great miracle happened there,\u201d And in Israel your dreidel will say, \u201ca great miracle happened here.\u201d And that is the symbolism of the dreidel.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now, how do you play dreidel? So, you want to start with some gelt. This is some Israeli gelt that my mom brought back for me from her latest trip. Um, and, I had to steal it away from my five-year-old son who like, holds onto this like its actual gold.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So, let&#8217;s pretend we&#8217;re playing with two players, everybody puts in, a coin to start. And if you were to spin the dreidel and land on nun, we&#8217;ll start with nun, if you were to land on nun, the Yiddish etymology of the dreidel nun, or \u201cnone,\u201d would stand for \u201cnothing.\u201d And so you would get nothing. \u201cWah-wah.\u201d Move on to the next player.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m gonna spin and I&#8217;m really going to hope for a gimel because it landed on gimel that time. But then that wouldn&#8217;t be any fun. So, you spin the dreidel, the next player spins the dreidel. If you land on gimel, gadol, this is the one you really want. So gimel, think \u201cgimme gimme gimme.\u201d That&#8217;s a really good one. You get everything. You get the whole pot. So you take all the coins. And then everybody would just put one back in, you\u2019d start again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So, next player goes. Hei, now hei is not too bad to get. Hei, you get half. So hei, \u201chalf.\u201d So you got two coins, you take one. If you have an uneven number, you round up. We&#8217;re generous, you get half the pot. Half and, a little.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lastly, if you roll and you get a shin. This is my son&#8217;s favorite, because there&#8217;s little song that goes with it to remember. So, if you get a shin, you put one in. Ah! Hey look at that! I actually got a shin! So, the shin song goes \u201cShin, shin, put one in.\u201d So, my son likes to taunt me with that. So, \u201cShin, shin, put one in.\u201d Most people will put people one coin into the pot. There are some traditions, um, as you can see the shin has three stems. And so some people put, the rule is they put three in. One for each stem.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s it. You basically go until either everybody has all the money, or one of the toddlers has a tantrum. Yeah, you can guess which one happens first, generally.</p>\n",

I gotta get it repaired, which means I have to go across town, and I\u2019m going to have to figure out to pay for it, because my rent is due [facepalm]</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Hey, it\u2019s OK, it\u2019s OK. It\u2019s just a phone. You\u2019ll get it fixed. No need to be so <i>melodramatic</i>.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Melodramatic</i>? Ha. That may have been\u00a0<em>dramatic\u00a0</em>but not <em>melodramatic</em>.<br />\n</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is <i>melodramatic</i>. Ah! My phone! What I\u2019m going to do? I\u2019m helpless. I\u2019m hopeless. I\u2019m worthless without my phone. I don\u2019t have time for this. I don\u2019t have money for this. I can\u2019t even use my phone to figure out how to fix my phone! (Throws up arms) Oh, what a world. What a world! </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Melodramatic</i>.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">2: Oh. Well, since you can\u2019t use your phone. We might as well \u2026 have a conversation. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1: OK, all right.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">2: What\u2019s the difference between <i>dramatic</i> and <i>melodramatic\u00a0</i>because to me both of your responses were\u00a0<em>melodramatic, </em>friend.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1: I mean, this is what I know: <i>Dramatic</i> literally means \u201crelating to a drama,\u201d which refers to a play, film, or show that deals with very serious topics. Death, loss, social conflict</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">2: Cell phones?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1: But metaphorically, something <i>dramatic</i> is very striking, moving, and yes (said with self-awareness), showing a lot emotion. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">2: K, then what is <i>melodramatic</i>?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1: Even more emotion. Over the top. Extra. <i>Melodramatic</i> is next-level <i>dramatic</i>. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">2: Definitely not mellow. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1: It comes from <i>melodrama</i>, which is a drama with exaggerated characters and sensational plots. Like a soap opera. Or one of those cheesy made-for-TV movies.<br />\n</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">2: Hey, I kinda like those. Did you ever see the one where the daughter kills her brother and father and runs away with her mother?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1: Let me just look it up on my phone &#8230; sounds kind of amazing</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">2: I\u2019m not going to say it, I\u2019m not going to say it!</span></p>\n",

                    "transcript": "<p>There are many theories as to why Friday the 13th is considered an unlucky day. Fortunately, there aren&#8217;t 13 of them. Aside from that whole horror movie thing, which is, to be sure, scary AF, there are some old, like Bible old, reasons why this day has inspired so many superstitions.</p>\n<p>Reason 1: Jesus. Anthropology professor Phillips Stevens Jr. has argued that fear of the date may have been inspired in the Middle Ages surrounding Christian beliefs about the death of Jesus Christ.</p>\n<p>According to Stevens, Jesus\u2019 Last Supper is said to have had 13 participants, including Jesus, and occurred on the evening before his crucifixion on a Friday, leading to dark associations between Friday and the number 13.</p>\n<p>Reason 2: Vikings and numerology. Sorry, Friday, but the fears around Friday the 13th may have to do with the unlucky number 13 itself. Here are a couple:</p>\n<p>Viking lore: where the trickster Loki is believed to be the 13th god in the Norse pantheon; numerology: where 13 is in low regard because it follows 12, considered a very \u201ccomplete\u201d number.</p>\n<p>Reason 3: self-fulfilling prophecy. The general rule of a <em>self-fulfilling prophecy</em> is that if you think it&#8217;s going to happen, it probably will.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re expecting unlucky things to happen, you might even change your habits on days like this. That means that, maybe Friday the 13th is unlucky &#8230; just because we say it is.</p>\n<p>Multiple studies estimate that businesses lose millions of dollars in revenue each Friday the 13th because some people avoid regular behaviors like traveling or making investments.</p>\n<p>Reason 4: <i>paraskevidekatriaphobia. </i>Yup, that&#8217;s a frighteningly long word there. It means &#8230; &#8220;fear of Friday the 13th.&#8221; Maybe the day is unlucky because you have to figure out how to pronounce this word each time it occurs on the calendar?</p>\n<p>Or maybe it&#8217;s Jason &#8230; OK, it&#8217;s definitely Jason, because I sure won&#8217;t be able to get him out of my head tonight.</p>\n",

No, it&#8217;s not. Sorry to burst your bubble.</p>\n<p>Here are the real stories &#8230;</p>\n<p>The ancient Romans named the days of the week after the planets as they understood them at the time. The planets, in turn, were named after gods. Germanic peoples then adapted these names to their own language and gods.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So, the beginning of the week started with the sun: Sunday\u00a0is modeled on the Latin dies Solis. In Latin, sol means &#8220;sun,&#8221; and dies &#8220;day.&#8221; When we brought it over to English, it eventually became, naturally enough, Sunday.</p>\n<p>Monday is the moon&#8217;s day. The name comes from the Late Latin lunae\u00a0dies, which means &#8220;moon&#8217;s day.&#8221; Yeah, the ancient Romans considered the sun and moon planets\u2014but hey, it was a different time back then. Just like\u00a0Sunday, it eventually became Monday in English.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tuesday: right there in the middle of the week. Maybe one of the most boring days of the week, too, right? Well, the origin of its name is actually one of the most wild stories. The Latin name for Tuesday was\u00a0Martis dies, &#8220;Mars&#8217;s day.&#8221; Mars was the Roman god of war, and way back when, Germanic peoples equated Mars with Tiw.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tiw was equivalent to the Norse god Tyr, god of sky and war. And he was pretty courageous. See, there was a huge wolf named Fenrir prophesied to kill Odin, king of gods. The gods decided to restrain the beast while he was still growing. Fenrir wouldn\u2019t let the gods bind him unless one of them stuck their hand in the wolf\u2019s mouth. Only Tyr was brave enough to do it. Dang, Tuesday, you literally took one for the team.\u00a0 Tiw, is remembered in Tuesday, &#8220;Tiw&#8217;s day.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Old English word for\u00a0Wednesday indicates that the day was named for the Germanic god Woden, also known as Odin, who was compared to the Roman god Mercury. Wednesday is &#8220;Woden&#8217;s day,&#8221; which might help you see why the word is spelled so unusually &#8230; Under Woden\u2019s supervision, earth and sky were created from the dead body of a giant named Ymir. Woden also helped create the first man and woman from an ash tree and an alder. Take that, Hump Day.</p>\n<p>Thursday\u00a0is also godly because it&#8217;s named after Thor. As the strongest of the Norse gods, he was the god of thunder. His magic hammer Mj\u00f6lnir was a fierce mountain-flattening weapon.</p>\n<p>Roman documents going back to the first century intermix Thor\u2019s strength and hammer with Hercules\u2019\u00a0bronze and club, but also with\u00a0Jupiter, the chief Roman god who controlled the thunder and sky. That&#8217;s why the Roman name for the fourth day of the week, dies Iovis, or &#8220;day of Jupiter,&#8221; became &#8220;Thor&#8217;s day.&#8221; Thursday.</p>\n<p>Thank the gods it&#8217;s &#8230; Friday. The Latin name for this day of the week was dies Veneris. This refers to the planet and deity Venus, goddess of love. To the Germanic peoples, Venus was Frig, wife of Odin, queen of Asgard, home of the gods. Frig was also said to have the power of prophecy. Some scholars associate her with Freyja, an Old Norse goddess of fertility, gold, and death. What&#8217;s more, she rode a chariot driven by two cats. Hard to beat that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alright, we&#8217;ve made it to our favorite day.

The name comes from the Late Latin lunae\u00a0dies, which means &#8220;moon&#8217;s day.&#8221; Yeah, the ancient Romans considered the sun and moon planets\u2014but hey, it was a different time back then. Just like\u00a0Sunday, it eventually became Monday in English.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tuesday: right there in the middle of the week. Maybe one of the most boring days of the week, too, right? Well, the origin of its name is actually one of the most wild stories. The Latin name for Tuesday was\u00a0Martis dies, &#8220;Mars&#8217;s day.&#8221; Mars was the Roman god of war, and way back when, Germanic peoples equated Mars with Tiw.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tiw was equivalent to the Norse god Tyr, god of sky and war. And he was pretty courageous. See, there was a huge wolf named Fenrir prophesied to kill Odin, king of gods. The gods decided to restrain the beast while he was still growing. Fenrir wouldn\u2019t let the gods bind him unless one of them stuck their hand in the wolf\u2019s mouth. Only Tyr was brave enough to do it. Dang, Tuesday, you literally took one for the team.\u00a0 Tiw, is remembered in Tuesday, &#8220;Tiw&#8217;s day.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Old English word for\u00a0Wednesday indicates that the day was named for the Germanic god Woden, also known as Odin, who was compared to the Roman god Mercury. Wednesday is &#8220;Woden&#8217;s day,&#8221; which might help you see why the word is spelled so unusually &#8230; Under Woden\u2019s supervision, earth and sky were created from the dead body of a giant named Ymir. Woden also helped create the first man and woman from an ash tree and an alder. Take that, Hump Day.</p>\n<p>Thursday\u00a0is also godly because it&#8217;s named after Thor. As the strongest of the Norse gods, he was the god of thunder. His magic hammer Mj\u00f6lnir was a fierce mountain-flattening weapon.</p>\n<p>Roman documents going back to the first century intermix Thor\u2019s strength and hammer with Hercules\u2019\u00a0bronze and club, but also with\u00a0Jupiter, the chief Roman god who controlled the thunder and sky. That&#8217;s why the Roman name for the fourth day of the week, dies Iovis, or &#8220;day of Jupiter,&#8221; became &#8220;Thor&#8217;s day.&#8221; Thursday.</p>\n<p>Thank the gods it&#8217;s &#8230; Friday. The Latin name for this day of the week was dies Veneris. This refers to the planet and deity Venus, goddess of love. To the Germanic peoples, Venus was Frig, wife of Odin, queen of Asgard, home of the gods. Frig was also said to have the power of prophecy. Some scholars associate her with Freyja, an Old Norse goddess of fertility, gold, and death. What&#8217;s more, she rode a chariot driven by two cats. Hard to beat that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alright, we&#8217;ve made it to our favorite day. Save the best for last, right?</p>\n<p>Saturday day was named for Saturn the planet, which the Romans named after their god Saturn. Yep, we just kept the old Roman name for this one. But, here&#8217;s the best part: Saturn was the god of plenty, of renewal, of time, of liberation. Now that&#8217;s what Saturdays are all about.</p>\n<p>Have a great week!</p>\n",

I would say that came about the way a lot of creative pursuits do in that I was just working with what I had.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve been writing ever since I was a kid because I just love stories. I love creating the idea of other people or other worlds and the things that take place in them.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reason that I got started writing and telling my own narrative was because I had a client who I went to an event with and I had my hair in a bun. And she pulled me aside and she said, \u201cNatalie, next time we go to these events, make sure your hair isn\u2019t in a bun because you look too Mexican when your hair is in a bun, and people don\u2019t always think Mexicans are smart.\u201d That really\u2026 one, hurt, but two, made me think how often, the narrative that we see about our community as Latinas and women of color are typically told, um, without our voices. And so, they\u2019re told inauthentically. While, you know, a lot of creative writers do a lot of research and uh, use that to inform their writing, there\u2019s something to be said about actually living the experience within our communities, and our cultures. And that really helps to create a very distinct and very authentic story.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once I got a little older, I think in the 5th grade and I learned about haiku, that was really game-changing because they\u2019re so short. So at that point, I didn\u2019t even need a paper and pencil. I just needed my brain. And it was something that I could do whenever, wherever. And it kept me occupied as a kid for hours. Still does. Especially on the train. [laughs]\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I really enjoy about writing is being able to craft words and sentences, and put them together in a way that triggers an emotion in a reader.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would very much like to say that I have a very specific routine for writing. But if I had a specific routine for writing, I would have a lot more writing done. Oh, my routine right now is actually that I have a riding partner who I work with on screenplays. And we do get together every single night. I think that I love is finding that thing inside \u2014 That idea, that moment \u2014 that is so&#8230; creatively satisfying. That&#8230; You just wanna stay up and work on it. Forever.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And you know, all a writer needs to do is write. Sit down. Write. Craft your story. Because your story\u2019s important and the world needs to hear it.</span></p>\n",

                    "transcript": "<p>For seven days from December 26 through January 1, African Americans across the US<br />\ncelebrate the joyous holiday of Kwanzaa, a social holiday that celebrates community, family,<br />\nand culture. Many people don\u2019t know this, but Kwanzaa is not an ancient holiday. If fact, it was<br />\nonly invented in 1966 by Dr. Maulana Karenga. As a professor of Black Studies, Dr. Karenga<br />\nwas able to imbue nearly every aspect of the holiday with cultural significance. Much inspiration<br />\naround Kwanzaa actually comes from harvest festivals. The word Kwanzaa comes from the<br />\nSwahili phrase matunda ya kwanza, which translates into \u201cfirst fruits.\u201d Each day of Kwanzaa has<br />\na special principle that\u2019s associated with it. The first day, December 26, recognizes Umoja, or<br />\n\u201cHarmony.\u201d December 27 celebrates Kujichagulia, which means \u201cSelf Determination.\u201d Then, in<br />\norder, we have: Ujima for \u201cCollective Work and Responsibility;\u201d Ujamaa for \u201cCooperative<br />\nEconomics;\u201d Nia for \u201cpurpose;\u201d Kuumba for \u201cCreativity;\u201d and the holiday ends on January 1,<br />\nwhere we celebrate Imani, \u201cFaith.\u201d Just as there are the Seven Principles associated with<br />\nKwanzaa, which are called the Nguzo Saba, and just as there are seven days to the holiday,<br />\nthere are also seven symbols that are attached to Kwanzaa, as well. The Mkeka&#8211;the straw<br />\nmat&#8211;represents tradition and foundation. The Kinara&#8211;the candle holder&#8211;represents our roots.<br />\nThe Mishumaa Saba&#8211;the seven candles&#8211;represent the Nguzo Saba, the \u201cSeven Principles.\u201d<br />\nThere\u2019s a black candle in the middle for Umoja (\u201cUnity\u201d). On the other side, there are three<br />\ngreen and three red candles, representing the six other principles. The Kikombe Cha<br />\nUmoja&#8211;the Unity Cup&#8211;isn\u2019t just about unity. It is used to perform the libation in honor of our<br />\nancestors. Mazao&#8211;the crop, which are presented in a bowl&#8211;are an essential part of any harvest<br />\nfestival. The Mazao is not to get confused with the Muhindi&#8211;the ears of corn. One is placed on<br />\nthe table to represent each child of the household. If there are no children in the household, two<br />\nears of corn are still placed. Finally, Zawadi&#8211;the gifts&#8211;are meant to encourage growth. It\u2019s not<br />\nabout the lavish gifts that you get, it\u2019s about how you use those gifts to better your life. Now,<br />\neverybody wants to know, \u201cHow do I say Happy Kwanzaa?\u201d Well, you don\u2019t! [laughs] In fact,<br />\nwhat you do say is, \u201cHabari Gani,\u201d which loosely translates to \u201cWhat is the news?\u201d From there,<br />\nthe person who celebrates Kwanzaa would respond with the principle attached to that day. And<br />\nfor anyone else who doesn\u2019t celebrate Kwanzaa, the would say, \u201cJoyous Kwanzaa!\u201d There\u2019s a<br />\nfasting from sun-up to sun-down, but every evening, we get together, and we light the candle<br />\nthat represents that day, we talk about that principle, and we embrace our culture through<br />\nreading, through dancing, and through music. Each night closes out with seven cheers of one of<br />\nthe most important ideas around Kwanzaa&#8211;Harambe, which means \u201cLet\u2019s pull together!\u201d A<br />\nJoyous Kwanzaa to all. Harambe!</p>\n",

But, did you know that, in one telling of his tale, his name Batman\u00a0stems from a childhood fear?</p>\n<p>In the 2005 movie Batman Begins, a young Bruce Wayne falls into a well on his parents&#8217; property, which is swarmed with bats. He grows up terrified of bats but he decides to challenge that fear by turning into one.</p>\n<p>He conquers his phobia by using it to fight villains in Gotham City. That&#8217;s courage.

Her real name is Princess Diana, and she comes from the female-only island of Themyscira [thuh-miss-er-uh], which the Greek gods gave to the Amazons who weren&#8217;t fans of &#8230; the male species. She is also the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta, the Amazon queen [pronunciation tip for host: [hi-pol-i-tuh].</p>\n<p>The Amazon princess received the name Wonder Woman after winning a battle with Captain Steve Trevor. She sets off to the &#8220;Man&#8217;s World&#8221; to promote what she (and her name) stands for: peace, honesty, and strength. As her original comic goes: &#8220;As lovely as Aphrodite\u2014as wise as Athena\u2014with the speed of Mercury and the strength of Hercules\u2014she is known only as Wonder Woman!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sure, we know Superman goes by another name when not sporting his red cape, ahem, Clark Kent. But, he has a third name, his real one\u2014and it has Hebrew roots.</p>\n<p>In Superman&#8217;s hometown of Krypton, his real name is Kal-El.</p>\n<p>The El in his name is thought to refer to a Hebrew word meaning &#8220;of God,&#8221; and Kal, &#8220;voice.&#8221; This means Superman&#8217;s official name, Kal-El could be translated to &#8220;voice of God.&#8221; Talk about childhood pressure &#8230;</p>\n<p>We can&#8217;t forget Robin, right? That&#8217;s because Robin and Batman are considered the Dynamic Duo. But Robin\u00a0is also a master fighter and acrobat on his own.</p>\n<p>Origin stories of the name Robin, the Boy Wonder, are many. It&#8217;s often cited that his original creator loved The Adventures of Robin Hood, hence Robin&#8217;s medieval-looking outfit. In one of the comics, Robin takes his name from a golden bracelet featuring a robin, given to him by his mother before she died.</p>\n<p>Wolverine might not have been born with his superhero name\u2014he also goes by the name James Howlett or Logan. He was born, however, with his special powers.</p>\n<p>Due to a &#8220;genetic mutation,&#8221; Wolverine possesses animal-like senses and claws in both hands, which are actually\u00a0bone.</p>\n<p>Because of his strong sense of animal characteristics (and the way he looks), he is called Wolverine.</p>\n<p>A wolverine is part of the weasel family (despite its name, unlike a wolf, which is in the canine category) and resembles more of a bear.

Nothing!</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s jump right in, shall we?</p>\n<p>Question #1: When listing a date range, what kind of dash should you use? For example: January 4 ____ February 4.</p>\n<p>In a date range like January 4\u2013February 4, you would use an en dash. An en dash is slightly longer than a regular dash (or hyphen), but shorter than an em dash. An en dash is used for a range or to connect the endpoints of a route. It can also show a contrast or connection between two words. Or, you can use it to replace the words <i>to</i>, <i>and</i>, or <i>versus</i>.</p>\n<p>Question #2: who vs. whom bwahahah.

For example: January 4 ____ February 4.</p>\n<p>In a date range like January 4\u2013February 4, you would use an en dash. An en dash is slightly longer than a regular dash (or hyphen), but shorter than an em dash. An en dash is used for a range or to connect the endpoints of a route. It can also show a contrast or connection between two words. Or, you can use it to replace the words <i>to</i>, <i>and</i>, or <i>versus</i>.</p>\n<p>Question #2: who vs. whom bwahahah.

And, uh, even though I\u2019ve grown up here my whole life I don\u2019t know that much about some of the smaller towns that are located in the great state of Kansas. Um, but my husband is from a small town south of Wichita. One time I was down there visiting and I got in a discussion with my father-in-law about a neighboring city called Ark City and, um, I said, \u201cNow, Ark City. Is that short for Ar&#8230;Arkansas City \u2018cause it\u2019s by the Arkansas River?\u201d And he looked at me very seriously and he said, \u201cNo, it is short for Ar-Kansas City and it is located near the Ar-Kansas River.\u201d And I just had to chuckle at that \u2018cause I said, \u201cWas that just to set yourself apart from Arkansas?\u201d And he said, \u201cYeah. Absolutely.\u201d So it turns out that Kansas, the name Kansas, comes from the Kansa tribe where Arkansas is the French pronunciation of a tribe from that area. Um, when Arkansas became a state, uh, they chose to keep the French pronunciation whereas, of course, when Kansas became a state they took the English form of the Kansa tribe name. Uh, so when Arkansas City established itself they decided to keep the, uh, Ar-Kansas, Arkansas spelling because they were near the Arkansas River, which they call the Ar-Kansas River. Anytime you find yourself in, uh, great Ark City, uh, do not call it Arkansas City. They will correct you. It is Ar-Kansas City.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contributor 2</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hello, my name\u2019s AJ and I\u2019m from Peoria, Illinois. Now maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m from here but, uh, Peoria, Illinois\u2019s never been too much trouble for me to say. I remember in high school, I went to Peoria High and we chant P-E-O-R-I-A! Easy to spell, easy to say, right? Well, apparently, not so much. I get junk call or something and you can tell that they\u2019re not from the area because, uh, even if they pronounce Peoria right they, they, like, pronounce it really timidly. Instead of Peoria, it\u2019s like, \u201cPee-orrr-ee-uh?\u201d Of course, you get&#8230;pe or-uh, peeorrhea, pariah, pure-uh, portia&#8230;that\u2019s even adding a letter, I\u2019m not even sure how that happens, but Peoria. Apparently, it\u2019s super hard to pronounce, but Peoria. Just spell it out. \u2018Course that\u2019s not unique, a lot of central Illinois cities and towns and even around Illinois there\u2019s a lot of different, uh, cities that get mispronounced. There\u2019s San Jose, Illinois&#8230;not San Jos\u00e9, Illinois, it\u2019s pronounced San Joes, Illinois. Down south, uh, southern Illinois you got Cairo, Illinois. It\u2019s not pronounced Ky-row, Illinois. It\u2019s Kay-row, Illinois. And yes, it\u2019s spelled exactly like Cairo, Egypt but it\u2019s pronounced Kay-row&#8230;because Illinois.</span></p>\n",

But, actually, I was corrected a lot<br />\nby everyone who lived there and said, \u201cNope, it\u2019s nuh-vah-duh, not nuh-vad-uh!\u201d<br />\nI also drove through Kentucky and stayed with a friend in what I thought was \u201cloo-ee-vil\u201d, or<br />\n\u201cloo-is-vil\u201d, but they take out a lot of those letters and just say \u201cloo-uh-vuh l\u201d. (laughs)<br />\nVery smooth. \u201cloo-uh-vuh l\u201d<br />\nAnd similarly, uh, New Orleans, in Louisiana, they all pronounce \u201cnaw-luh nz\u201d Louisiana.<br />\nSounds much cooler.<br />\nBack on the East Coast. I grew up in Massachusetts. Every time we went to the town<br />\nWorcester, I would see these signs that said: \u201cwor-kester\u201d or \u201cwor-sester?\u201d Or maybe,<br />\n\u201cwor-chester?\u201d Uh no! It\u2019s pronounced, \u201cwoo s-ter\u201d<br />\nIf you\u2019re a local Massachusetts-ian, and you have any kind of Bostonian accent, you\u2019re probably<br />\nactually going to say it, \u201cWuhstah.\u201d<br />\nA lot of letters in there, just kinda suggestions. (laughs)<br />\nAnd then similar to Worcester is Gloucester and Leicester. They both have that c-e-s<br />\ncombination that Worcester does that you kinda just smoosh all together. So, Gloucester looks<br />\nlike \u201cglow-ses-ter\u201d or \u201cglow-kester?\u201d But it\u2019s \u201cglos-ter.\u201d Like glossy.<br />\nAnd then my favorite is Reading, which is spelled exactly the same way as reading. And of<br />\ncourse, there\u2019s also a North Reading in Massachusetts. When you\u2019re on the highway, the sign<br />\nfor North Reading is abbreviated as \u201cNo. Reading.\u201d And so it looks like \u201cno reading.\u201d It looks like,<br />\n\u201cIf you take this exit, you are entering a town where reading is banned.\u201d (laughs)<br />\nSo I remember always being really concerned about that when I was little.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

So, the word toboggan means, &#8220;a long, narrow, flat-bottomed sled made of a thin board curved upward and backward at the front, often with low handrails on the side, used especially in the sport of coasting over snow or ice.&#8221; So, tobogganing is, uh, sledding!

Now, when it comes to the pronunciation of February, February has two Rs, but a lot of times, a lot of people like to drop that first R and replace it with a Y. And this is a natural process called dissimilation. And what this means is, if the same sound reoccurs, together in a word, then people will start to differentiate the two instances, which means the R now sounds like Y.

[show tomato on screen]\n<p>Fruit or vegetable?</p>\n<p>Speaker 2: Fruit, for sure.</p>\n<p>Speaker 3: I agree, fruit. Fruits have seeds.</p>\n<p>Speaker 1: Correct! It is a fruit. And just as a fun fact, an avocado is also a fruit, but it&#8217;s technically considered to be a berry.</p>\n<p>Speaker 2: What?</p>\n<p>Speaker 3: Seriously?</p>\n<p>Speaker 1: Yes! A berry is a fruit with a pulpy\u00a0pericarp [on screen: pericarp: the walls of a ripened fruit]\u00a0in\u00a0which\u00a0the\u00a0seeds\u00a0are\u00a0embedded. That definition matches the avocado.

I just bring the definitions.</p>\n<p>Speaker 3: Hey, really quickly, I just need to know: is it pronounced like pi-kahn or pi-kan?</p>\n<p>Speaker 2: Pee-kan.</p>\n<p>Speaker 1: All pronunciations are accepted.</p>\n<p>Speaker 2: Fine, but caramel is said like kar-muhl, not kair-uh-mel.</p>\n<p>Speaker 1: Actually, both of those are also OK to say.</p>\n<p>Speaker 2: I can&#8217;t even.

Unemployment, as you know, is when you don\u2019t have a job or, more specifically, when you are laid off from a job and therefore you receive compensation on a weekly basis from the EDD. So, during this time you are supposed to be looking for a job. Sometimes you know your job is coming back and you\u2019re only going to be laid off for a certain amount of time so during that time, rather than looking for another full-time job, you can take that time and kind of do some stuff that you wanna do. For example, I used to work for a very big reality TV show and we only ran for a certain amount of time and then we would have several months that we had off. Well, during that time that we had off, where I was not only using my savings but had my unemployment, I was able to focus on some of the things that I really wanted to do in the rest of my life and it was really really fun. And then I would go back to work as soon as it was time to get back on.</span></p>\n<p><b>Contributor 2\u00a0</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have definitely experienced funemployment. And, it\u2019s really fun in the beginning because you get all to, you know, go to the beach, or hang out with friends who also work weird hours, maybe they work at a restaurant or something. And you just get to derp around all day. Until you realize, you don\u2019t have any money! Because your source of money, was your job. And, you didn\u2019t actually file for unemployment. So, you have to get back on the grind of applying and the fun goes away.</span></p>\n",

You\u2019ll pick up that document or read that email and just cringe a little because someone maybe a co-worker or a peer has written something that is inappropriately worded. And I\u2019m&#8211; listen, there are the standards we\u2019ll say. The Usual Suspects. The YOUR vs. the YOU ARE or THERE as in a place, or THEY ARE, contraction. That usage&#8211; if you haven&#8217;t figured that out and you&#8217;re a certain age&#8230; I&#8217;m worried about you, okay? So&#8230; But my big two were kind of a surprise to me. The first being, sort of an oddity if you will. It&#8217;s the contraction of \u201cyou all\u201d. Which my Southerers out there will understand it&#8217;s y&#8217;all and that is Y apostrophe A L L. There are some monsters of the universe who choose to make the contraction with the apostrophe between the A and the first L. NOPE. That ain\u2019t how it goes, bros.\u00a0 Because, again, we are contracting \u201cyou all\u201d and the Y is what\u2019s retained, and we lose you know for whatever reason those two vowels and then it&#8217;s that contraction. So, that&#8217;s a big one for me. I see it and i\u2019m like, \u201cyou don&#8217;t know any better do you?\u201d</p>\n<p>CONTRIBUTOR 2</p>\n<p>My grammar pet peeve is the incorrect use of there, they\u2019re, their. So \u2026 there, T-H-E-R-E, referring to a physical place. They\u2019re, T-H-E-Y-apostrophe-R-E, a contraction for \u201cthey are.\u201d And their, T-H-E-I-R, which shows possession.</p>\n<p>So, for example, if you\u2019re using it in a sentence, \u201cWe\u2019re going over there for dinner.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s T-H-E-R-E. Um, \u201cThey\u2019re inviting us over for dinner.\u201d so, they are, T-H-E-Y-apostrophe-R-E. Or, \u201cHave you seen their new dog?\u201d, T-H-E-I-R.</p>\n<p>I think it really bothers me because it completely changes the context of a sentence when you\u2019re writing out the incorrect there//they\u2019re/their so people should just use a different word in the sentence to see if it still makes sense, um, especially they are.

You\u2019ll pick up that document or read that email and just cringe a little because someone maybe a co-worker or a peer has written something that is inappropriately worded. And I\u2019m&#8211; listen, there are the standards we\u2019ll say. The Usual Suspects. The YOUR vs. the YOU ARE or THERE as in a place, or THEY ARE, contraction. That usage&#8211; if you haven&#8217;t figured that out and you&#8217;re a certain age&#8230; I&#8217;m worried about you, okay? So&#8230; But my big two were kind of a surprise to me. The first being, sort of an oddity if you will. It&#8217;s the contraction of \u201cyou all\u201d. Which my Southerers out there will understand it&#8217;s y&#8217;all and that is Y apostrophe A L L. There are some monsters of the universe who choose to make the contraction with the apostrophe between the A and the first L. NOPE. That ain\u2019t how it goes, bros.\u00a0 Because, again, we are contracting \u201cyou all\u201d and the Y is what\u2019s retained, and we lose you know for whatever reason those two vowels and then it&#8217;s that contraction. So, that&#8217;s a big one for me. I see it and i\u2019m like, \u201cyou don&#8217;t know any better do you?\u201d</p>\n<p>CONTRIBUTOR 2</p>\n<p>My grammar pet peeve is the incorrect use of there, they\u2019re, their. So \u2026 there, T-H-E-R-E, referring to a physical place. They\u2019re, T-H-E-Y-apostrophe-R-E, a contraction for \u201cthey are.\u201d And their, T-H-E-I-R, which shows possession.</p>\n<p>So, for example, if you\u2019re using it in a sentence, \u201cWe\u2019re going over there for dinner.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s T-H-E-R-E. Um, \u201cThey\u2019re inviting us over for dinner.\u201d so, they are, T-H-E-Y-apostrophe-R-E. Or, \u201cHave you seen their new dog?\u201d, T-H-E-I-R.</p>\n<p>I think it really bothers me because it completely changes the context of a sentence when you\u2019re writing out the incorrect there//they\u2019re/their so people should just use a different word in the sentence to see if it still makes sense, um, especially they are. You can just break it apart to see if it fits in the sentence.</p>\n<p>CONTRIBUTOR 3 &#8211; PART 1</p>\n<p>Commas.</p>\n<p>One of my biggest grammatical pet peeves is people that don&#8217;t use commas at all, ever.\u00a0 This is especially noticeable in social media posts. \u00a0 People just don&#8217;t use commas at all. Now I&#8217;m not going to go through all the rules because there&#8217;s there&#8217;s quite a few rules for using a comma, it&#8217;s a pretty prevalent punctuation so, I&#8217;ll just name a couple that should be pretty easy for people to use. \u00a0 Especially on the internet people don&#8217;t use commas when attributing a quote before you say quote you got to put a comma in there you know. You know this celebrity said comma then the quote, it&#8217;s easy I don&#8217;t understand why people can&#8217;t remember to do that, it&#8217;s just one little comma. \u00a0 The second one and this is one the boggles my mind the most is when you make a list of items or events or things you know just you&#8217;re listing off, like several, you know, four or five things, put a comma between them.</p>\n<p>CONTRIBUTOR 3 &#8211; PART 2</p>\n<p>Further and farther are very similar words, but did they get misused a lot. Now both can be adverbs and adjectives however their generally used as adverbs and that&#8217;s when people misuse them. \u00a0 The problem is people misuse them by interchanging them when they&#8217;re just ever so slightly different. \u00a0 They&#8217;re not the same word the general grammatical rule is <em>further</em> is a relation to metaphorical distance where <em>farther</em> is of actual physical distance.\u00a0 Now the definitions of the words are <em>further</em>: going or extending beyond; <em>farther:</em> at or to a greater distance or more advanced point. \u00a0 The way I can remember it is I can throw something far but I can&#8217;t throw it fur.</p>\n",

I bet they taste delicious.</p>\n<p>Wait, why did I use both of those words to describe the same thing. Is there a difference? [host points as if to cue the intro screen]\n<p>Of course there&#8217;s a difference. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re here making this video. Ready? Here we go.</p>\n<p><em>Delicious</em> and <em>luscious</em> are very similar words, which is why they are often confused with each other.</p>\n<p><em>Delicious</em> comes from the Latin <em>deliciae</em> [dey-<strong>lee</strong>-kee-ay], meaning &#8220;delight.&#8221; Something delicious is delightful, for sure. [host smiles and looks up as\u00a0 image of strawberries comes up over his head]\n<p>Usually, though, <em>delicious</em> refers to something that delights the senses, like taste or smell. Tasty food, like these strawberries, is often described as <em>delicious</em>. But, really, anything that you find pleasing can be delicious. It may sound funny, but you could say: &#8220;My dad has a delicious sense of humor.&#8221;</p>\n[host says this as an aside] To me, anyway. His terrible dad jokes aren&#8217;t for everyone &#8230; I get it.</p>\n<p>However, when it comes to using\u00a0<em>delicious</em> over\u00a0<em>luscious</em>, it&#8217;s not a clear answer. The biggest advice we can give you is that, when describing something as <em>luscious</em><em>,\u00a0</em>it&#8217;s best if you&#8217;re trying to say that it is <strong>extremely</strong> delightful to the senses.</p>\n<p><em>Luscious</em> implies a particular richness or ripeness\u2014a luxury. You wouldn&#8217;t call a richly decorated mansion <em>delicious</em>,\u00a0 but it is probably <em>luscious</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Luscious</em> is also associated with, ahem, arousing sexual desire. You might describe a beautiful person&#8217;s shiny long hair as luscious.</p>\n<p><em>Luscious</em> can be used to describe something that looks, tastes, or smells especially wonderful, too, like a fragrant, creamy chocolate cake. Mmm \u2026 chocolate cake with strawberries. I&#8217;m hungry, in case y&#8217;all can&#8217;t tell.</p>\n<p>Rhat brings me back to this wonderful bowl of strawberries. They are so ripe and juicy, they look and smell absolutely delicious. [takes a bite] And <em>luscious</em>, too.</p>\n",

She may say, &#8220;Yesterday-ago we went to the beach.&#8221; And, she&#8217;s talking about a family vacation that we took three months ago.

But it was reclaimed during the first Chicano movement in the sixties and seventies. And it made a resurgence, uh, within the last ten years that was focused on staying in touch with indigenous roots of Mexican people. Growing up I always felt that I was kind of in between two cultures. I wasn\u2019t quite Mexican, but I wasn\u2019t quite American, either. Even though I was born in the US, I have Mexican family and I speak Spanish and it was always hard for me to figure out who I was. In college, when I was at orientation and I was trying to find something to get involved with. And I was talking to a group called Chicano Student Programs, and I asked them, \u201cWhat does Chicano mean?\u201d I had never heard it before. And they described something that really impacted me and it\u2019s made me understand my identity so much more. It described who I am in a way that I had never thought of before where I wanted to be in touch with who I was, uh, and who my family is. But I also have another identity as being an American, and this really describes that intersection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a Hufflepuff, you might ask? It\u2019s not so much a \u201cwhat\u201d as a \u201cwho.\u201d It is the last name of one of the founders of the four Hogwarts houses.

The Gryffindors are cool and popular and strong and brave, but for a lot of us, um, I think as we grew up, we started to realize that the other houses had really important values, too. I can walk into a room full of people and say, \u201cHey, what\u2019s your Hogwarts house?\u201d and suddenly we could all find a point of reference to better understand one another. When I walk into a room and say, \u201cI\u2019m a Hufflepuff!\u201d what I\u2019m saying is I value loyalty and honesty. I\u2019m saying that I may not be the bravest or the strongest or the most cunning or the most intelligent, but I care about my friends and I\u2019m going to do what\u2019s right because it\u2019s the right thing to do and not because I expect to be rewarded for it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So the first time I heard the word chink, I was in 5th grade.

But it was reclaimed during the first Chicano movement in the sixties and seventies. And it made a resurgence, uh, within the last ten years that was focused on staying in touch with indigenous roots of Mexican people. Growing up I always felt that I was kind of in between two cultures. I wasn\u2019t quite Mexican, but I wasn\u2019t quite American, either. Even though I was born in the US, I have Mexican family and I speak Spanish and it was always hard for me to figure out who I was. In college, when I was at orientation and I was trying to find something to get involved with. And I was talking to a group called Chicano Student Programs, and I asked them, \u201cWhat does Chicano mean?\u201d I had never heard it before. And they described something that really impacted me and it\u2019s made me understand my identity so much more. It described who I am in a way that I had never thought of before where I wanted to be in touch with who I was, uh, and who my family is. But I also have another identity as being an American, and this really describes that intersection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a Hufflepuff, you might ask?

It is Latin for, \u201cAnd you, Brutus?\u201d\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Julius Caesar was a Roman General and he went off and won all of these wars and came back to Rome and everyone in Rome loved him. They just thought he was the most amazing person ever and they wanted to make him the emperor. Some of his other generals and some of the Senators in Rome did not love Julius Caesar. As a matter of fact, they really disliked him and they were terrified that he was going to use this opportunity to become the emperor, so they conspired to kill him. One of Julius Caesar\u2019s best friends, Marcus Brutus, was part of the conspiracy. He decided he needed to kill Caesar with love&#8230;so that he wouldn\u2019t turn into a tyrant. When Julius Caesar came back from the wars there was a soothsayer or a truthsayer or a future seer who told him to beware the Ides of March. The Ides of March is the 15th of March. Caesar didn\u2019t understand what he meant. Well, it turns out on the Ides of March Caesar went to the Capitol and that is where he was killed. They all literally stabbed him in the back and the very last persona to do so was Marcus Brutus. And when Brutus gave that last stab in the back, Julius Caesar turned and looked at him and said, \u201cEt tu, Brute?\u201d before dying.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYou too? You\u2019ve betrayed me too?\u201d It\u2019s often used in a comedic or ironic way. Say, for example, I go out to, uh, have lunch with a friend of mine and I\u2019m complaining about the fact that I don\u2019t have a job, but I need more money and I can\u2019t pay my bills and this is the time that my friend decides to remind me that I owe him $25\u2026\u201dEt tu, Brute?\u201d\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So kids, when it\u2019s almost winter break and every teacher has given you homework but the last teacher of the day, who never gives you homework, you know is going to let you out early, and she tells you to have a book read by the end of break&#8230;now you know what to say.</span></p>\n",

It\u2019s actually the only language that has this character is German and its pronounced with a double ss. So Wei\u00dfenburg looks like \u2018</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vi-sen-berg</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2019, but it\u2026it\u2019s not. That was interesting to learn. We never actually got a chance to go to Wei\u00dfenburg, but one place we did go is Munich, and it\u2019s a pretty popular German city. Everyone knows Munich, but for the longest time I couldn\u2019t figure out where M\u00fcnchen was. and I spent a lot of time looking for it on a map. Turns out that\u2019s how Germans pronounce Munich they say, \u201cM\u00fcnchen.\u201d While I was in Germany I played soccer for my high school team and we played against a lot of teams across Germany and from one city in particular it was Stuttgart, but on paper it looks like, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2018stuht-gahrt\u2019</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Also when we got to Germany for the first time and we landed at the airport we were being driven to the place where we were going to end up and all of us kids we kept seeing signs for a city for like an hour. Over and over again we kept driving past signs for this city and the cities name was Ausfahrt, so we finally asked the driver like is this the capitol &#8230; like \u201cwhat is this city that there\u2019s so many signs for\u201d, and he let us know that that actually just means exit. </span></p>\n",

This was a man\u2014yes, usually a man\u2014of superhuman strength, courage, or skill. They were venerated as demigods, or &#8220;part divine and part mortal,&#8221; like the legendary Hercules or Maui.</p>\n<p>English has the word by the 1500s for these mythic figures, but by the 1600s, <em>hero</em> was already naming people, regular ol&#8217; people, of great bravery (usually soldiers) or achievement, like the astronomer Galileo.</p>\n<p>And again, these were also usually men. That&#8217;s not because women were never considered heroic. From Amazon queens to Joan of Arc, history remembers many\u2014though not nearly enough\u2014examples. It&#8217;s just that they were called <em>heroines</em>, a female form of <em>hero</em>.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, this gender divide has largely fallen away today. George Washington, Abraham Lincoln: American <em>heroes</em>. Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks: Also American <em>heroes</em>.</p>\n<p>Now, characters who don&#8217;t have the traditional qualities of a\u00a0<em>hero</em>, but who we still often root for anyways, are <em>antiheroes</em>, like Huckleberry Finn &#8230; or Homer Simpson.</p>\n<p>And then we have\u00a0<em>superheroes</em>, a term actually found in the 1890s but, since the 1960s, now mostly used of comic-book characters like Wonder Woman or Batman. These are mythical characters of superhuman strength, courage, or skill, almost god-like in their abilities.</p>\n<p>The word\u00a0<em>hero</em> has come a long way, but the Avengers of the Marvel universe really aren&#8217;t all that different from Achilles of ancient Greece, right?</p>\n",

Aside from that whole horror movie thing, which is, to be sure, scary AF, there are some old, like Bible old, reasons why this day has inspired so many superstitions.</p>\n<p>Reason 1: Jesus. Anthropology professor Phillips Stevens Jr. has argued that fear of the date may have been inspired in the Middle Ages surrounding Christian beliefs about the death of Jesus Christ.</p>\n<p>According to Stevens, Jesus\u2019 Last Supper is said to have had 13 participants, including Jesus, and occurred on the evening before his crucifixion on a Friday, leading to dark associations between Friday and the number 13.</p>\n<p>Reason 2: Vikings and numerology. Sorry, Friday, but the fears around Friday the 13th may have to do with the unlucky number 13 itself. Here are a couple:</p>\n<p>Viking lore: where the trickster Loki is believed to be the 13th god in the Norse pantheon; numerology: where 13 is in low regard because it follows 12, considered a very \u201ccomplete\u201d number.</p>\n<p>Reason 3: self-fulfilling prophecy. The general rule of a <em>self-fulfilling prophecy</em> is that if you think it&#8217;s going to happen, it probably will.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re expecting unlucky things to happen, you might even change your habits on days like this. That means that, maybe Friday the 13th is unlucky &#8230; just because we say it is.</p>\n<p>Multiple studies estimate that businesses lose millions of dollars in revenue each Friday the 13th because some people avoid regular behaviors like traveling or making investments.</p>\n<p>Reason 4: <i>paraskevidekatriaphobia. </i>Yup, that&#8217;s a frighteningly long word there. It means &#8230; &#8220;fear of Friday the 13th.&#8221; Maybe the day is unlucky because you have to figure out how to pronounce this word each time it occurs on the calendar?</p>\n<p>Or maybe it&#8217;s Jason &#8230; OK, it&#8217;s definitely Jason, because I sure won&#8217;t be able to get him out of my head tonight.</p>\n",

Because the Islamic calendar is 10\u201311 days shorter than the solar calendar, the date of Islamic New Year varies throughout the year. The day is more of a low-key, prayer-filled day.</p>\n<p>Host 1:\u00a0 What about New Year&#8217;s in India?</p>\n<p>Host 2: It depends on where you are. India is a large and diverse country.

One of the reasons the <em>bourgeoisie </em>are so unpopular? Well, in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, communist Karl Marx put forward the theory that the <em>bourgeoisie </em>exploits the proletariat also known as the workers, under capitalism\u2014not a great look.</p>\n<p>In the 1960s, a time when the counter-culture was on the upswing in the United States, <em>bourgeois </em>was shortened to <em>bougie</em>. Anyone who took on the attitude or look of the middle class was deemed <em>bougie</em>\u2014and it wasn&#8217;t a good thing. The term was adopted particularly in Black American community to describe middle class or wealthy Black folks, or those with upwardly mobile aspirations.</p>\n<p>Today, <em>bougie</em>, sometimes spelled b-o-u-g-i-e, sometimes j-i-e, sometimes with two e&#8217;s at the end, is found particularly in hip-hop music, like the 2017 hit &#8220;Bad and Boujee&#8221; by Migos. Some folks, particularly in the Black community, have reclaimed the <em>bougie </em>moniker for themselves as a statement of their fabulousness. Some things Bougie Black People love, according to writer Damon Young at <em>The Root</em>? Pretending to enjoy La Croix, Questlove, and natural hair. More power to them.</p>\n<p>But seriously, I am <em>not bougie</em>. I just love pumpkin spice lattes.</p>\n",

One night, Cassia was walking home when a charming man approached with an invite to a mysterious drama called \"The Vomitorium.\" Cassia followed him to an ancient amphitheater. As he led her through the passageway next to the seats, she was confused when he opened a door that led underground. Inside were three men: Gaius, Ivan the Terrible, Vlad the III ... plus two empty chairs. As she realized who they were and where she might be, hell, Gaius started vomiting all over Ivan. Ivan couldn't handle it. He threw up on Vlad. Vlad seemingly enjoyed it\u2014weird, Dracula\u2014but wasn't immune and began puking. The vicious circle continued. Cassia bolted back into the passageway vomiting in the opening that led to the seats: The Tenth Circle of Hell, the Vomitorium. This story is fictional. Do not judge a word by how it sounds. A vomitorium, coined in the 1700s, is a passageway in ancient theaters that led to the seats, allegedly where ancient Romans deliberately vomited during feasts.",

We can thank him for <em>stan</em>. And I&#8217;m, like, kind of obsessed with this fact.</p>\n[Title slide]\n<p>In 2000, Eminem came out with the track, &#8220;Stan.&#8221; It was about a fan, named <em>Stan</em>, who becomes dangerously obsessed with him.</p>\n[Open to cutting: The song and video also featured the singer Dido. Remember Dido? [Hums part of chorus of &#8220;Thank you.&#8221;] Oh yeah, we still <em>stan</em> Dido.]\n<p>&#8220;Stan,&#8221; apparently, made an impact on another hip-hop artist, Nas, who used <em>stan</em>\u00a0as an insult for &#8220;an obsessed fan&#8221; in a 2001 diss track.</p>\n<p>How <em>stan</em> spreads from there is one of the fascinating mysteries of language, but by 2008, <em>stan</em> is on Urban Dictionary and Twitter.</p>\n<p>Into the 2010s, <em>stan\u00a0</em>was taken up in online fandom culture as a noun and verb. If you&#8217;re really into Mariah Carey, you&#8217;re a <em>Mariah stan</em> or you <em>stan Mariah</em>. [Can cut out, too: And, as any true <em>stan</em> of Mariah will know, her fans even have a nickname:\u00a0<em>lambs</em>.]\n<p>Early on, <em>stan</em> could have a negative connotation. It could imply &#8220;excessive&#8221; or &#8220;crazy,&#8221; like Eminem&#8217;s Stan.</p>\n<p>People definitely described themselves as <em>stans</em>, but they could be seen as too into the celebrities or fictional characters they loved\u2014to the point of going at other people if they criticized their faves.</p>\n<p>Now, <em>stan</em> has evolved somewhat. As a verb, <em>to\u00a0stan</em> is more generally &#8220;to love or admire&#8221; someone. It&#8217;s often used in the phrase <em>we stan</em> when a famous person is being authentic or relatable or &#8230; just being decent and doing what&#8217;s right. Not always for the big, obvious stuff.</p>\n<p>Like when Chris Evans helped Regina King onto the stage at the Oscars &#8230;</p>\n<p>Or, when my mailman gives treats to all the doggos on my street.

And that ain\u2019t right. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">No accent is more correct than another.\u00a0</span><span class=\"s1\">And, here\u2019s the irony.

We talk one way around the kitchen table and another in the conference room. This is a <i>good</i> thing. We can speak in different ways to get different things done.

We were at a dinner at my husband&#8217;s grandma\u2019s house. And she did not want that bread buttered, and so she screamed and threw a fit and was just beside herself. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I read that if your child is throwing a temper tantrum to kind of get on their level, get at eye level, so they know you\u2019re looking right at them and not towering above them. And just kind of say, \u201cI know you\u2019re upset, I\u2019m sorry Mommy buttered your bread, um, but how can we make this better?\u201d And just kind of talk them down. Because toddlers, and really, kids of any age will go through every emotion in a matter of seconds, just to kind of test the waters. So, if they know that you\u2019re, you know, on their level and talking to them, then they\u2019re more likely to be more reasonable. So, we were able to exchange the buttered bread for regular bread and everything was OK.</span></p>\n<p><b>Contributor 2</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One day we, uh, were, uh, at the supermarket and she want something. And she start crying and she start screaming. And she, you know, the whole package. So she start rolling on the ground or something. And she was, I believe she was 2 or 3. Well, I was not having it. So, I just um put my knees down and get myself to her level and so I try to talk to her and she was not responding. And I just said, I don\u2019t know out of no where I just said breathe. Darling breathe. And I don\u2019t know why she, she really did it she started breathing (Breathing in). (Laughs) In the middle of the crying and everything. And she start breathing and we did it for like 3 or 4 times. Deep breathing.\u00a0 Just breathe. Yes. Do it again.(breathes in) And she\u2019s five now and that\u2019s my go to.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><b>Contributor 1</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have also learned that another great tool is: distraction. You know. Anything else. Oh, look at that over there. What\u2019s the doggie doing? Oh, look at grandma, what\u2019s she having for dinner? You know, anything else that can distract them from the current situation that is making them upset is another great idea.</span></p>\n",

This is my very first journal when I was in his class, and it stretched to \u2026 there are two shelves of journals here!</p>\n<p>Writing is pretty much my favorite activity in the whole world. My favorite thing about being a writer is that I get to do it all the time, and make a living off of it, which is really the dream! One of the reasons that I&#8217;m here and I&#8217;m able to do this for work is that I had a really significant teacher in my life. That teacher&#8217;s name is Ryan Gobel. He was my sophomore year English teacher. He had a really inventive and engaging and unique teaching style. Um, and he interacted with us like, um, in a more, I don&#8217;t know, collegial kind of way, which was great and the first time that had ever happened to me. What he mostly did is he encouraged me to take my writing seriously, as something that was worthy of my time and worthy of attention.</p>\n<p>My seventh grade English teacher, Mrs. June P. Garrett, at Signal Mountain Junior High School in Signal Mountain, Tennessee. Mrs. Garrett loved to laugh, and I liked to write funny essays whenever I had a homework assignment. And she liked what I wrote so much, she wrote in the margins of one of my papers, &#8220;You will make your living as a writer someday!&#8221;</p>\n<p>I was a daily writer for a very long time, and it grew into a book that&#8217;s called Maid and it has been translated into, I think, maybe twelve languages. Most of my English teachers have, in some way, given me something. Uh, you know, Mrs. Book from fifth and sixth grade, Mrs. Strasnefski in high school. Uh, but the really, the one teacher I think who uh imprinted me most significantly is probably uh Doctor Kobre, Mike Kobre, a professor of mine in college.

Don&#8217;t you love asking the question: &#8220;Who can tell me an element from the Periodic Table?&#8221; So, this year, try posing it like this: &#8220;Who can declare, disclose, explain, express, inform, instruct, mention, notify, report, reveal, say, speak, state, summon, let slip &#8230;</p>\n<p>You got this teachers!

I had a friend who was hosting a German foreign-exchange student and this foreign-exchange student loved my friend\u2019s dog. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Um, he would always call the dog \u201cSchatzi\u201d and I didn\u2019t really understand that because it wasn\u2019t the dog\u2019s name. So I finally asked about it and he explained to me that it was a term of endearment that you might use for, you know, a romantic partner or a family member, um, even a co-worker or a pet and I just thought that was so neat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Um, I later actually learned that it is also the name of a dog from \u201cThat 70\u2019s Show,\u201d um&#8230;which apparently it\u2019s a very common dog name, but I can see why \u2018cause there\u2019s something so special about calling someone or something your \u201clittle treasure.\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Um, I really enjoy that. So, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">schatzi</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Try calling somebody you know </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">schatzi</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> today and, uh, see how they respond. (Laughing)</span></p>\n",

If you don&#8217;t drive over the ___olden ___ate ___ridge in San Francisco, are you even a real tourist?</p>\n[contestants guess]\n<p>Yes, you should capitalize every word in Golden Gate Bridge. Landmarks and monuments also start their proper names with capital letters, such as the Empire State Building and the Golden Gate Bridge. Street names are always capitalized, too (e.g. Main Street). Go forth and capitalize correctly folks!</p>\n",

And because nuances and rules are typically not fun we&#8217;re asking these people tough capitalization questions so you can laugh at them &#8230; and learn, of course. We&#8217;ve got 3 sets of questions coming up about some of the weirdest capitalization rules &#8230; are you ready? Question #1: It&#8217;s all in the family &#8230; in the following sentences, do you capitalize ___randpa? ___randpa Ed danced all night long. My ___randpa is much cooler than me.</p>\n[contestants guess]\n<p>Grandpa Ed danced all night long. My grandpa is much cooler than me. Words that indicate family relationships should also be capitalized when used as titles in front of a person\u2019s name. However, if you\u2019re just talking about relationships with no names involved, the titles shouldn\u2019t be capitalized. Question #2: In good company\u00a0&#8230; Do you always have to capitalize company names?</p>\n[contestants guess]\n<p>The names of companies and organizations should also be capitalized, such as Nike and Stanford University. There are some exceptions: Sometimes a company may choose not to use a capital letter at the beginning of its name or product as a stylistic choice. Examples include eBay and the iPhone. It&#8217;s all about style, folks. Alright, you may be asking what other capitalization questions can be left?! But, don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ve got one more up our sleeves with this last question &#8230; Question #3: Ahoy, landmarks ahead (host rolls their eyes at this one).

There\u2019s a reason for that!</p>\n<p>The word <em>search</em> is a derivative of the Latin <em>circus</em>, which means \u201ccircle\u201d (not the tent with the animals or acrobats).</p>\n<p>This eventually turned into the late Latin <em>circare</em> (\u201cto go around\u201d) and transformed into the Middle English <em>serchen</em> by the 1300s.</p>\n<p>Even <em>search</em> was <em>searching</em> for its true self for thousands of years \u2026 kind of like how you\u2019re looking for direction on this site, but now you\u2019re just trapped in the Dictionary.com equivalent of a YouTube loop \u2026</p>\n<p>Second, did you know that there are actually 14 definitions of the word? That\u2019s a lot of meaning for a seemingly unhelpful word (or web page).</p>\n<p>So \u2026 even if this page wasn\u2019t what you were <em>searching</em> for, hopefully we\u2019ve taught you a little something about one of our favorite words.</p>\n<p>And, pro tip: type something into the search bar next time you come to the site.</p>\n<p>It will help you find what you\u2019re looking for a little faster (fun fact: <em>found </em>has four definitions for you to peruse over on that page, just saying).</p>\n",

It downloaded apps <i>instantly</i>. It streamed videos <i>smoothly</i>. It<b> </b><i>also</i><b> </b>had <i>far</i> more space than I <i>ever</i> had <i>before</i>.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After I paid for it, I held my phone <i>as lovingly</i> and <i>carefully as</i> a newborn baby. But, <i>when</i> I stepped <i>outside</i>, a runner appeared out of nowhere. He was going <i>too</i> <i>fast</i><b> </b>and<b> </b>I couldn\u2019t get out of the way. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Crash! The collision sent my phone into the sky. I saw it flipping <i>over</i> and <i>over</i> <i>again</i>, like in slow-motion, then plummet<b> </b>to the ground. <i>Nervously</i>, I picked it up. It was <i>completely</i> shattered. My brand-new baby had cracks <i>here</i>, <i>there</i>, <i>everywhere</i>.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Fortunately</i>, I also saved up for phone insurance.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Adverbs tell us how, when, where, and to what degree something happens. In this way, they modify verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">First, adverbs can tell how something happens or is done. <i>Patiently</i>, <i>instantly</i>, <i>lovingly</i>, <i>nervously</i>. These adverbs typically modify verbs and can appear throughout a sentence. Often they add <i>-ly</i> to existing adjectives, but not always, as in <i>going fast</i>, which makes them easy to confuse for some adjectives. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Second, adverbs can tell when something happens. <i>When</i>, <i>then</i>, <i>again</i>. <i>Ever</i> <i>had</i> <i>before</i>. These are often special words all their own in the language and sometimes shift around in a sentence.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Third, adverbs can tell where something happens. We don\u2019t mean, like, Paris or the moon. We mean <i>here</i>, <i>there</i>, <i>everywhere</i>. I stepped <i>outside</i>. These kinds of words.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Finally, adverbs can tell the extent or degree of something. <i>So</i> nice. <i>Too</i> fast. <i>Ridiculously</i> expensive. These adverbs often modify adjectives and other adverbs.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Adverbs are extremely useful and common, but they also can be incredibly frustrating. Like smashing a new phone. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Which brings to mind another part of speech: interjections. <i>Ahhhhhhhhhh!</i></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

                    "transcript": "<p>Hi. I&#8217;m April Reign, the creator of OscarsSoWhite.</p>\n<p>In January of 2015, I was still a practicing attorney, um, and I had no connection whatsoever to the entertainment field, other than the fact that I was a rabid consumer of film. Uh, so the Oscars particularly were like my Super Bowl. There were special snacks involved. I&#8217;d rope off the TV so everybody knew this was mommy&#8217;s night. I&#8217;d watch the pre-show, the show, the after show, the show the next day. Everything about the Oscars I loved.</p>\n<p>Uh, so I was&#8230; That morning, January 2015, I was watching the nominations on one of the morning television shows, and it just struck me for no particular reason that year because, unfortunately, it happened both before then and since, um, there were no people of color nominated in any of the acting categories. 20 different spots. So I picked up my phone, um, which is typically embedded in my forearm, and got on social media and tweeted, &#8220;OscarsSoWhite they asked to touch my hair.&#8221; And that was it. I then went on to work, uh, and then when I checked in on Twitter around lunchtime, the hashtag based on that one tweet was then trending internationally.</p>\n<p>Um, as I said, this was a very organic campaign, I guess. I wasn&#8217;t even planning for it to be a campaign or a movement initially. Uh, I was just thinking out loud. (laughs) Very often, I think out loud on Twitter to share my thoughts, um, with my followers and whoever is interested.</p>\n<p>I know generally, having had hashtags go internationally viral both before OscarsSoWhite and since, that hashtags have to be short, um, first and foremost. You know, in January of 2015, we were still relegated to 140 characters, not the 280 that we have now, uh, so every single letter, every single word or phrase matters. Um, and so I knew that OscarsSoWhite was short. I was hoping that it was to the point, (laughs) even though, um, years later, people still pretend at least to misunderstand what my meaning was with that phrase. Um, and I was hoping that it would be memorable. And, in fact, it was. Uh, and so now, um, here we are now in year six of OscarsSoWhite, and people are still using the hashtag. And, in fact, um, the phrase has broadened. You know, now there is a JournalismSoWhite and an EducationSoWhite and even a BrooklynSoWhite, none of which I started, um, I think that goes to show that, um, when you are doing something that makes sense that can be universal, and that&#8217;s what you want a hashtag to be, people may take it and riff off of it, um, to make it their own, and then I think that&#8217;s great.</p>\n<p>Um, so hashtags sh- should be short, they should be to the point, um, they should ensure that your message is getting across in just that one phrase, um, and hopefully they are memorable.</p>\n<p>To people who are interested in creating their own viral movements or campaigns, um, you know, I would say you can absolutely start on social media, but don&#8217;t stay there. Um, remember that there are people who don&#8217;t use social media (laughs), surprisingly enough, uh, so you need to meet people where they are. Hashtags are great for getting a conversation going, and hopefully that conversation will continue, even if you&#8217;re not leading it. Um, but you also need to write. You need to speak. Um, i- but if you have an issue that touches your heart, um, something that you feel passionate about, um, something that you want to see changed, absolutely get on social media, regardless of the size of your platform, and start talking about it using that hashtag, and then get your friends, family, and followers involved, um, to help you with your campaign. Good luck.</p>\n",

Here&#8217;s what I found &#8230;</p>\n<p>The definition (on the one and only Dictionary.com) confirms my thoughts, get this &#8230; <em>silly</em> means &#8220;<span class=\"one-click-content css-1p89gle e1q3nk1v4\" data-term=\"weak-minded\" data-linkid=\"nn1ov4\">weak-minded or lacking good sense; stupid or foolish: <span class=\"luna-example italic\" data-term=\"writer\" data-linkid=\"nn1ov4\">a silly writer,&#8221; or &#8220;</span></span><span class=\"one-click-content css-1p89gle e1q3nk1v4\" data-term=\"ridiculous\" data-linkid=\"nn1ov4\">absurd; ridiculous; irrational: <span class=\"luna-example italic\">a silly idea,&#8221; or &#8220;</span></span><span class=\"one-click-content css-1p89gle e1q3nk1v4\">stunned; dazed.&#8221; So, yea, those aren&#8217;t great definitions.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>But, did <em>silly </em>always mean these things? Why does everyone think it&#8217;s such an endearing word?</p>\n<p>Well, back in the early 1200s, the original sense of <i>silly</i> was \u201cblessed\u201d or, more accurately, \u201cspiritually blessed.\u201d Huh?</p>\n<p><i>Silly</i> actually is from an Old English word: <i>ges\u01e3lig</i>, meaning \u201chappy, blessed.\u201d In Middle English, this <i>ges\u01e3lig </i>started to mean \u201choly, innocent, helpless,\u201d then \u201cpitiable\u201d and \u201cinsignificant,\u201d then \u201csimple\u201d and \u201cignorant.\u201d By the end of the 1500s, <i>silly</i> was used for \u201clacking good sense, foolish, irrational, ridiculous.\u201d</p>\n<p>So, with that in mind, I&#8217;ll give my family and friends the benefit of the doubt when they call me <em>silly</em> &#8230; because they&#8217;re &#8220;blessed&#8221; to have me in their lives, regardless of what they call me \ud83d\ude09</p>\n",

Unfortunately for Mr. Swift, the internet got a hold of it.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>OK, so I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve realized I&#8217;m really into dogs and dog speech. But what does it actually mean to <em>bamboozle</em> someone?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Well, as far as we can tell, the earliest meaning of <em>bamboozle</em> was &#8220;to deceive by trickery, hoodwink,&#8221; which is why some believe that it arose among the criminals of the underworld. So for example, &#8220;I thought he was helping me walk across the street but he was picking my pocket! I have been bamboozled!&#8221;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>By 1712, it acquired the sense &#8220;to perplex; mystify.&#8221; It is not known for certain, but this sense might have emerged under the influence of the Scottish word <em>bumbaze</em> (or <em>bombaze</em>), meaning &#8220;to confuse.&#8221; Given that alcohol is pretty good at making people act in confusing or mystifying ways, it shouldn&#8217;t be much of a surprise that in the 1800&#8217;s <em>bamboozle</em> began to be used as slang for &#8220;drunk.&#8221;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>So, there you have it folks. While we may still feel pretty <em>bamboozled</em> by the origins of the word\u00a0<em>bamboozle</em>, it&#8217;s no real cause for heckin&#8217; concern. But, if you do start to get concerned, just do a quick search for <em>bamboozled</em> doggo and you will feel better &#8230; trust me.</div>\n<div></div>\n",

Now this shouldn\u2019t be confused with the very similar phrase, \u201cI need more time.\u201d Which is more of a request than an expression of regret.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the saddest words in the dictionary to me is inequality. Simply put, there is unfairness in a system, a society, a country. Now, I believe that all men are created equal because we are of one race: the human race. So wherever, or whenever, there is unfairness or inequality, it is up to us, the human race, to address and rebuke such matter, because we are all created equal and we should all be treated with equal rights, consequence, and respect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The word alone can be a very sad word, and I think it\u2019s one of the saddest words in our vocabulary. While being alone technically means being separate or isolated, I don\u2019t think that in itself is always a bad thing. I think some of us enjoy being physically alone. And that can be good sometimes, we enjoy our, um, our solitude. But sometimes when we use the word alone, we use it more as in an emotional sense such as, \u201cI\u2019m feeling alone in my thoughts.\u201d Or, \u201cI\u2019m feeling alone in my opinions.\u201d And that type of loneliness, I think, is much harder to understand. When my first child was born, and I was home on maternity leave, even though I was physically with my newborn child, and there were a lot of friends and family members who were supporting me through that time, I still felt very lonely. As in, nobody understands what it feels like to have to raise a brand new human being and have no idea what you\u2019re doing.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So we can feel alone in the decisions that we\u2019re making, in the opinions that we have, um, in our emotions, we can feel alone, and that\u2019s when I think the word alone can take on a very profound sense of sadness, and it\u2019s something that is much more complicated to figure out than just being physically by yourself.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n",

                    "transcript": "<p>Hi. I&#8217;m April Reign, the creator of OscarsSoWhite.</p>\n<p>In January of 2015, I was still a practicing attorney, um, and I had no connection whatsoever to the entertainment field, other than the fact that I was a rabid consumer of film. Uh, so the Oscars particularly were like my Super Bowl. There were special snacks involved. I&#8217;d rope off the TV so everybody knew this was mommy&#8217;s night. I&#8217;d watch the pre-show, the show, the after show, the show the next day. Everything about the Oscars I loved.</p>\n<p>Uh, so I was&#8230; That morning, January 2015, I was watching the nominations on one of the morning television shows, and it just struck me for no particular reason that year because, unfortunately, it happened both before then and since, um, there were no people of color nominated in any of the acting categories. 20 different spots. So I picked up my phone, um, which is typically embedded in my forearm, and got on social media and tweeted, &#8220;OscarsSoWhite they asked to touch my hair.&#8221; And that was it. I then went on to work, uh, and then when I checked in on Twitter around lunchtime, the hashtag based on that one tweet was then trending internationally.</p>\n<p>Um, as I said, this was a very organic campaign, I guess. I wasn&#8217;t even planning for it to be a campaign or a movement initially. Uh, I was just thinking out loud. (laughs) Very often, I think out loud on Twitter to share my thoughts, um, with my followers and whoever is interested.</p>\n<p>I know generally, having had hashtags go internationally viral both before OscarsSoWhite and since, that hashtags have to be short, um, first and foremost. You know, in January of 2015, we were still relegated to 140 characters, not the 280 that we have now, uh, so every single letter, every single word or phrase matters. Um, and so I knew that OscarsSoWhite was short. I was hoping that it was to the point, (laughs) even though, um, years later, people still pretend at least to misunderstand what my meaning was with that phrase. Um, and I was hoping that it would be memorable. And, in fact, it was. Uh, and so now, um, here we are now in year six of OscarsSoWhite, and people are still using the hashtag. And, in fact, um, the phrase has broadened. You know, now there is a JournalismSoWhite and an EducationSoWhite and even a BrooklynSoWhite, none of which I started, um, I think that goes to show that, um, when you are doing something that makes sense that can be universal, and that&#8217;s what you want a hashtag to be, people may take it and riff off of it, um, to make it their own, and then I think that&#8217;s great.</p>\n<p>Um, so hashtags sh- should be short, they should be to the point, um, they should ensure that your message is getting across in just that one phrase, um, and hopefully they are memorable.</p>\n<p>To people who are interested in creating their own viral movements or campaigns, um, you know, I would say you can absolutely start on social media, but don&#8217;t stay there. Um, remember that there are people who don&#8217;t use social media (laughs), surprisingly enough, uh, so you need to meet people where they are. Hashtags are great for getting a conversation going, and hopefully that conversation will continue, even if you&#8217;re not leading it. Um, but you also need to write. You need to speak. Um, i- but if you have an issue that touches your heart, um, something that you feel passionate about, um, something that you want to see changed, absolutely get on social media, regardless of the size of your platform, and start talking about it using that hashtag, and then get your friends, family, and followers involved, um, to help you with your campaign. Good luck.</p>\n",

Is <i>promiscuous</i> just a dressed-up attempt to avoid words like <i>slutty</i> or <i>whore</i>?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Today, the word <i>promiscuous</i> is most commonly used for \u201chaving sexual relations with a number of partners on a casual basis.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When first recorded in the 1570s, however, <i>promiscuous</i> meant \u201crandom\u201d or \u201cmixed in a disorderly way.\u201d <i>Mixed</i> is key, because <i>promiscuous</i> comes from a Latin word, <i>pr\u014dmiscuus </i>[proh-<b>mis</b>-koo-<i>uh</i>s], literally meaning \u201cmixed about.\u201d </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This Latin root had the sense of \u201cin common\u201d or \u201cindiscriminate.\u201d A <i>promiscuous crowd </i>was made up of both commoners and aristocrats. Or, a <i>promiscuous event</i> was open to all. <i>Promiscuous</i>, then,<i> </i>was not concerned with sex, but with social class. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">By the mid-1600s, <i>promiscuous </i>was describing something or someone as \u201cundiscriminating\u201d in their choices. One example from around this time called birds <i>promiscuous</i>, because they ate everything from seeds to insects. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But, when we humans aren\u2019t thinking about sex, it seems we\u2019re making judgments<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span>about other people\u2019s lifestyle choices. By the end of the 1800s, <i>promiscuous</i> was squarely in the bedroom, characterizing people who had a lot of casual sex\u2014people who aren\u2019t being discriminate about who they are having sex with. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And, given our double standards about sex in society, it\u2019s no surprise, sadly, that women have been larger targets of the word <i>promiscuous</i> than men have.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Not everything is sex and sexism with the word promiscuous today, though. It\u2019s sometimes used more metaphorically for something \u201cdone too freely or frequently\u201d\u2014like <i>He\u2019s promiscuous with his credit card number, giving it out to just anyone who asks for it</i> or <i>The company\u2019s promiscuous use of the word \u201corganic\u201d made us question just exactly where the food came from</i>.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s hard to get away from sex\u2014and sexism\u2014with <i>promiscuous</i>, but perhaps this is one word that should really&#8230; get around more.
